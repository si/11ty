> _Measure team health more rapidly and regularly with this simple framework_

![Capture five dimensions with a simple form](images/PETALS-mobile-form.png)

In 2022, I created a simple new framework to help engineering teams become more aware of their overall health called **PETALS**. We identified and simplified to 5 key dimensions that influence team health:

- **Productivity**
- **Enjoyment**
- **Teamwork**
- **Learning**
- **Stress** (now **Serenity**)

By scoring each dimension out of 5, we can calculate **Averages** for that individual or across a team of scores. This then creates a simple _PETALS_ 🌸 visualisation using a RAG (Red, Amber, Green) colour scheme for rapid observability and continuous improvement discussions.

**Check out the [original Product On A Page](http://sijobling.com/blog/pop-petals/) and [thorough explanation on EM Hub](https://emhub.io/articles/how-i-built-a-framework-to-measure-team-health).**

Interested to know more? [Reach out to me](mailto:si@jobling.com) for a one-on-one PETALS workshop to discuss and provide ongoing support.

## Q&A

**How do you gather the data - is it self reported or observed (or both)?**

Data is gathered anonymously through an online form (Microsoft or Google) which populates an worksheet (Excel or Google) for analysis, and only available to the team for self-reflection.

**How do you set the numbers (e.g. what's level 2 stress vs a level 3)**

Numbers aren't defined, more subjective to the individual, but we provide guides for 1 and 5 extremes (e.g. ENJOYMENT 1 is sad, 5 is ecstasy)

**Is this a private metric or so you share with other team members or aggregate for a team health metric?**

Metrics are team-wide but anonymised and limited to them only. It's not for other teams to compare (although leadership could compare at a higher-level "garden" view to identify any trends)

**How do you plan to use this in your day-to-day management conversations?**

Conversation is focused in team meetings (retros, standup, etc) but when discussing with other management, we can identify any factors or actions that can help the team.
