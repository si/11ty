A list of products I use where we both get discounts and benefits from personalised links.


[Descript](/descript) is my go-to app for all audio and video production now. The revolutionary UX using AI to automatically transcribe audio along with all the neat little tools allows you to quickly produce audio and video content 10x faster than traditional methods. 🎙️

[Fathom](/fathom) is a great alternative to Google Analytics for measuring your website audiences without all the extra guff and privacy first (no cookie warnings needed). [Get £10 off your first month with my referral link](/fathom) and I get 25% back 📊

[Freetrade](/freetrade) is a great and convenient platform for buying and trading shares from their simple-to-use app. [Get a free share worth £10-100 by using my referral link](http://sijobling.com/freetrade). 💰

[IFTTT](http://sijobling.com/ifttt) is one of my favourite tools for automating services with each other, especially for habit tracking and productivity hacks. [Get 10% off with my referral code](http://sijobling.com/ifttt) and I’ll get a small kick back too 🤖

[Octopus Energy](http://sijobling.com/octopusenergy) as a more ethical customer focused energy supplier in the UK, £50 each in credit 🐙

[Pinecast](https://pinecast.com/) with promo code `r-b0b82e` for hosting unlimited podcasts 🎙

[Rescue My Car](/rescuemycar) is our chosen car breakdown cover - always been reliable, friendly and no extra unexpected costs. [Use my referral](/rescuemycar) for £5 voucher each. 🚗  
  
[Setapp](http://sijobling.com/setapp) is a great collection of macOS and iOS apps through their own subscription. You pay one flat fee every month to get a huge variety of apps fully licensed. [Try it out and I get a free month](http://sijobling.com/setapp). 💻

[Shavekit](/shavekit) are my favourite online shaving products, partly for the eco-friendly cork handle but also the quality of their blades and shaving cream. [Get 10% off your first kit and I’ll get credit too](/shavekit) 🪒
