Inspired by Chris Burnell's [/interests directory](https://chrisburnell.github.io/interests-directory), this is my collection of personal interests.

## Entertainment

House music 🎶 - right at the top of my interests, house music was my first love before I met my wife on mutual (clubbing) ground and raised two kids who also appreciate the uplifting genre

Comedy 🎭 - my TV tastes are getting worse now, really hard to please, but comedy always hits the spot

Sci-fi books 📚 - I like to try many genres but often find the modern sci-fi's grip me more

Vinyl digging 🔊 - harking back to my teenage/twenties, spending all my "spare" money on records, I now indulge in hours of record and antique shop browsing for that golden nugget

## Sports

Derby County 🐏 - born and raised on home turf, still follow my beloved [Super Rams](http://superrams.com) every season hoping for better

England (men and women) 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 - long time sufferer of the men's team on every competition but now realised how much better the womens game is

Snooker 🔴 - since a child, always enjoyed watching on TV, even in black & white. Therapeutic to watch.

Basketball 🏀 - as a teenager, spent many hours shooting hoops with my sister and best mate, following NBA (Houston was my team)

Rugby 🏉 - such a powerful, disciplined and respectful sport compared to the more popular option, love watching the [international competitions](https://6nationscalendar.com)

Jogging 🏃 - when my knees allowed, loved jogging around the rural village scenery. Now it's cross-training in the gym

Swimming 🏊 - get me in the water and I'll go for lengths, especially when abroad

## Food

Dark coffee 🫘 - turn it up to 6, can't stand popular coffee chains like Starbucks (burnt) and Costa (bland)

Pale ales 🍻 - most Indian Pale Ales hit the spot, hazys can be nice, although often cause me discomfort

Dark chocolate 🍫 - I don't tend to have a huge sweet tooth but I am impartial to the darker varieties

Cooking savoury dishes 🍽️ - never been bothered about baking but I love to make meals, often inspired by Jamie Oliver

## Tech

Podcasting 🎙️ - got the bug around 2005 with my house music podcast and still obsess over audio production

Frontend coding 👨‍💻 - this is where I found my forte in tech, making websites

Low code 🤖 - connecting and automating services for habit tracking like IFTTT and Zapier

Design 🎨 - I've always tried to be creative with tech, from pixel-f\*cking in Windows Paint

Social media & communities 👥 - the power of connecting people through tech, especially on the decentralised social web where we can own our content

Apple 📱 - sold into the ecosystem about 2007 and never looked back

## Other

Travelling 🗺️ - France and Greece are my favourites
