<h2>Life</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Highlight of the week was a trip to Disneyland Paris via Dover-Calais ferry. Why are British roads such a mess compared to Europe? The worst part is always on the "smart" motorways, limiting speeds to 50mph for the majority of the trip despite there being low volume. Toll roads to Paris only cost €17 and 80mph is a good cruising speed with no traffic either. More toll roads in the UK please!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Disneyland – a joy for the kids at endless cost for the parents. We forked out for FastPasses to enjoy all the main attractions with minimal waiting times. It's also worth talking to customer services at City Hall if your child has special needs as they will try to accommodate them. We got priority access for our son's autism diagnosis so there were no long waits for rides.&nbsp;(Hat-tip to my <a href="http://ontheside.network/">On The Side</a> friend <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/dom-hodgson/">Dom Hodgson</a> aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCihsHBTdowfmrYtO-q7Ze2Q">UKDisDad</a> for his invaluable advice ahead of travelling too - he certainly knows his stuff)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We stopped at <a href="https://www.staycity.com/paris/apartment-hotels-near-disneyland-paris/">Staycity Aparthotels</a> - a brand new accommodation experience just 10 minutes from Disneyland with a free regular shuttle. It still smells of paint, beds were ridiculously comfortable (not great wanting to sleep when you need to be up early for the parks) – but there was no bottle opener in the kitchen. In France?!&nbsp;Sacré bleu! Jokes aside, it was easily resolved by asking at reception and I'd highly recommend this accommodation if you're considering Disneyland Paris with the family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zero contact with the office over the past few weeks - not even New Years messages to the team (all my contact details are on my work phone <em>at home</em> so it proved quite tricky).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On my return though, I will negotiate bringing my leaving date forward. If that goes to plan, only 4 weeks left at <a href="https://www.asos.com/">ASOS</a>. That time will fly but, I'm sure, drag at points. I just hope a replacement is confirmed soon so I can start handover and end this chapter on a high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm looking forward to a new challenge in 2020 at <a href="https://www.worldfirst.com/">WorldFirst</a> though; returning to finance, exploring new ways of working and delivering software across multiple timezones and cultures, learning about other industries and communities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Health</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We've got a 50km walk challenge across the <a href="https://www.jurassiccoastchallenge.com/">Jurassic Coast</a> planned for May so time to get in some training. I intend to close my Apple activity rings every day this year (maybe allow 1-2 days a month buffer). I started the running regime Saturday morning after an unexpected early wake-up call –&nbsp;managed 3.5km in about 20 minutes, not bad considering the lack of exercise over the past few weeks. Back to the gym Monday too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From next week, time to have a booze detox following the <em>festivities</em> (allowing for a few treats with weekends out planned). I'm also removing milky coffees from my diet; I've become far too addicted to a flat whites at work so going back to black coffee or the occasional soya replacement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Side Projects</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> series 1 concluded this week with <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/mike-hince/">Mike Hince</a>. There have been over 100 listens since launch with a gentle climb of followers and subscribers over the month so it's certainly tapping in to a niche but to a limited audience. I've ramped up promotion of a "binge listen" (as I know some people prefer that approach) which seemed to engage quite well and even tried some Facebook advertising to improve visibility. The next series of guests are lined up for recording from next week and I'm looking forward to announcing the roster over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good old <a href="https://multipack.co.uk/">Multipack</a> friend <a href="https://www.andydev.co.uk/">Andy Yates</a> has also made a great start on the new <a href="https://github.com/sportstimes/f1">open-sourced version</a> of <a href="https://f1calendar.com/">F1 Calendar</a> with quite a few PR's raised over the festive break (very encouraging to see the early motivation and output –&nbsp;especially during an apparent break from work).&nbsp;<a href="https://andyhiggs.uk/">Andy H</a> and I have both lacked the time to maintain the existing version which has caused a bit of a stir with incorrect times (following F1 updates) so, hopefully, this will help alleviate the problem where anyone can fix and update the service that is extremely popular.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've also been thinking about the future of <a href="https://housefinesse.com/">House Finesse</a> too and whether it's time to sunset it (inspired by the conversation with Mike about Howler). As we're in the 15th year, we're no longer breaking ground as podcasts are now mainstream and established as a talking format. Heavyweights like <a href="https://defected.com/">Defected</a> and other professional DJs have a firm grasp on the streaming market and my personal interest is losing momentum. It might be time to call it but will be discussing options with my Finesse Brothers (Stu and Matt) and a few other industry contacts over the coming weeks about where to take it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Travelling to Paris for 4 days has certainly limited my entertainment consumption (French TV certainly didn't relate to me) but we have been catching up on some of the Christmas content on our return. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000ct7y/the-trial-of-christine-keeler-series-1-episode-1">The Trial of Christine Keeler</a> on BBC has certainly grabbed my attention with it's political angle, delightful 60s theme and crime thriller nature. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/joe-lycett-im-about-to-lose-control">Joe Lycett's I'm About to Lose Control</a> on All4 was probably the best comedy standup we've seen for a few months too. The fact my wife used to work with his dad definitely helps to relate with him, obviously with all the Birmingham and Black Country references we personally get.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://letterboxd.com/si/film/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/">The Rise of Skywalker</a> was a joy to watch at the weekend too –&nbsp;a brilliantly epic conclusion to the saga, well directed, produced and acted by the whole team. I'm not sure if I felt a little underwhelmed at the end or disappointed that's the end (for now). Surely Disney will be exploring all the spin-off's though to make sure the franchise stays alive and continues to bring in the dollar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, as part of my personal wellbeing for the new year/decade, I'm trying to read a little more than 2019. I've setup a daily habit in TickTick to read for 20 minutes - perfectly feasible considering I spend over 90 minutes on the train every weekday. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I got <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1844544613/">Red Herrings and White Elephants</a> for Christmas (thanks Mum!), a curious non-fiction book diving in to the origins of English idioms we use every in our day-to-day conversations. It's interesting to observe so many originate from nautical times of years past; "<em>you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours</em>" came from the idea that disobedient crew-mates were made to whip each other with cat o' nine tails with the likelihood of returning the favour in the future so took it easy on their counterparts.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, the team moved desks to a new floor, physically closer to our dependent teams which should improve communication and relationships. For me, it’s not a big thing with the pending departure and other recent moves, but I gathered from the team it’s quite an emotional event. I do find it funny how comfortable people get in their working environments, especially when we encourage “hot-desking” across the whole of the company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve also been trying to negotiate my departure date from ASOS back to the end of January, all pending leadership sign-off. It’s scary to think that the first month has flown by (the two week Christmas break certainly helped) but I’m also keen to wrap up my time with some specific goals. Three months notice can have their benefits from a management perspective but much less so from the employee's perspective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of which is to back-fill some leavers I inherited when I joined the team. It’s been a long drawn-out process trying to source the candidates but came good this week with an impressive candidate interviewing really well and offer accepted. Interestingly, as part of the negotiation, they asked about a career development plan for them which made us (speedily) pull together what we have to offer. It’s quite impressive to see what engineers get from the company, especially at the scale we’re talking about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Life</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first family birthday of the month/year/decade was for my step-dad this week. We decided to get him some refillable beer bottles with some guest ales from a local indie shop, <a href="http://rugbytap.co.uk/">Rugby Tap</a>. They get new casks in every week and open most weeknights until at least 8pm so I'll be returning there in the future to reduce my recycling waste of beer bottles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the vicinity, we had a lovely breakfast at our new favourite haunt, <a href="https://www.cv22rugby.com/collections/tickets">Inside The 22</a>. A great environment for food, drink and entertainment opposite Rugby School (where the game was originally invented). The owner told us they host band nights and had an album launch planned for Saturday evening so, when we heard the music that was coming, we suggested a friend's band Blue Nation he should reach out to. Sounds like that will be happening soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also returned to Walsall Saturday evening for a friend's first gig in many years. She was awesome, blasting out a range of classics from the 80s and 90s (which actually provoked a new <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKbU77Ew5WTH6KdCSUSfq7zj1XBLoCiDr">Nineties YouTube Music playlist</a>). We used the opportunity to catch up with some old local chums&nbsp;too; Graham, the man who introduced me to my good lady wife nearly 20 years ago and Alex, another long-term friend from our youth. Aah, reminiscing times…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Health&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve hit the gym every day in the office (typical start-of-year motivation combined with my pending departure) and I've been mostly focused on weights and strength. I’m now on the bars and currently shifting 40kg which I gather is quite an impressive start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve now eased off the dairy coffees too, hitting the soya flat white instead of my preferred full-fat milk <em>#SoHipster</em>. I’ve not felt the benefit yet but the texture and taste is actually quite pleasant despite early concerns. I'm also considering an intolerance test to try understand what my dietary demands could be following research with my ongoing abdominal pains.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also went for a whole week without meat for our main evening meals; a combination of fish and meat-free replacements complimented with fresh vegetables or salads. Weekends are when we tend to indulge (not binge!) on alcohol so that's accompanied with the occasional meats. I think a 4:3 balance is good enough, especially with the balance towards meat &amp; alcohol free.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Sides</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://si-cast.pinecast.co/">Si ‘Cast</a> is back, reviving an old format that was intended for <a href="https://verbaldiary.show/">Verbal Diary</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve gone back to twice daily recorded voice memos on the drive to and from the train station. It gives me 10 minutes to plan the day and reflect on the reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is unedited, off-the-cuff audio on very low-tech (iPhone 11 with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/voice-record-pro/id546983235">Voice Record Pro</a> posted straight to <a href="https://pinecast.com/">Pinecast</a>). It’s audible but not high quality - I want it to be an authentic recording summarising a similar theme to these week-notes (and actually help summarise them).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m time-boxing this to a few weeks to see how it goes and grows. If it’s not sustainable or yielding any interest, I’ll can it. It’s low effort and zero cost though so not too challenging, just part of a daily routine and, with the conclusion of my time at ASOS and new job approaching, it could be a great time to capture for personal prosperity. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> is back in the recording studio for season 2, starting with <a href="https://twitter.com/brandedbynaomi">Naomi White</a> (née Atkinson) on Friday. I’ve long appreciated Naomi’s design work and side projects plus she’s been very prevalent in the speaking community too so it’s fascinating to hear her story, especially as we share a similar background at university.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also realised the 6 Nations competition was fast approaching so started looking into setting up my <a href="https://6nationskickoff.com">typical calendar service</a> for it. Following some quick research, it turns out the official source are finally <a href="https://www.sixnationsrugby.com/add-to-calendar/">offering calendar downloads</a> and subscriptions including TV broadcasters. I feel like my work is done in this space now they’ve realised the value (it's only taken 12 years) so I won’t be trying to compete for traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the calendar front, <a href="https://andydev.co.uk/">Andy Yates</a> has been making amazing progress on the <a href="https://dev.f1calendar.com/">F1 Calendar</a> rebuild as that season fast approaches too. We hope to have it ready in the next couple of weeks so, if interested, make sure you follow <a href="https://twitter.com/f1cal">@F1Cal on Twitter</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/sportstimes/f1">Github project</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, <a href="http://sijobling.com/blog/from-si-cast-to-verbal-diary/">Verbal Diary</a> has been shelved. James and I have always struggled to schedule a regular recording time and now we're no longer working together with new jobs, it's become even harder. I don't want to say it'll never happen again but, for the foreseeable future, we'll be wrapping it up. (I'll probably let the domain expire at the end of this month - it's $30/year which just seems wasteful).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p07t80ht/ladhood">Ladhood on BBC</a> has caught my attention this week; another coming-of-age comedy series based on a bunch of lads growing up in Leeds in the noughties. It resonates quite well with me with some of the topics covered plus I find the creator, Liam Williams, very familiar; he has an air of John Simm and Andrew Lincoln about the way he talks.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Herrings-White-Elephants-Albert-Jack/dp/1844544613">Red Herrings and White Elephants</a> is still keeping me enlightened on the origins of everyday idioms. Personal favourites include&nbsp;"<em>pommy or pom</em>" (the Australian's wrongly accused nickname for Brits as <em>Prisoners of Mother England - P.O.M.E.</em>) and "<em>berk</em>" (a mildly-humorous put-down which is actually abbreviated from the Cockney-rhyming slang for "<em>Berkshire Hunt</em>").</p>

<p><strong>WeekNotes 3 touch on final dates at ASOS, tech tools, #FortyFest, walking Jurassic Coast, food intolerances, #MakeLifeWork, #HouseFinesse, Year In Reviews, bass guitars, #DeadwaterFell, #Murmurs, Paul Velocity, DJ EZ, Hed Kandi and more idiom origins.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a week of discussions, we’ve finally managed to negotiate my final date at ASOS to the end of January –&nbsp;kudos to my line manager for chasing and supporting my desire to wrap up my ASOS tenor so I can begin the next chapter at WorldFirst sooner.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The priority from that was initiating handover with my replacement which we fast-tracked into documents, notes and details of all the necessary data sources for the team KPI’s. It's actually quite satisfying to see how many new tools and metrics I’ve shifted from frontend development to backend APIs over the last 5 months. I’ve swapped <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a>, <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> for <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> for <a href="https://tasks.office.com/">Planner</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> for <a href="https://products.office.com/en-gb/sharepoint/collaboration">SharePoint</a> (don’t ask!)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obviously, the most important thing after that was arranging leaving drinks. I’ve decided the Thursday would be better suited for maximum availability plus our monthly Tech Develops falls on the Friday so, whilst I’m wrapping up and doing final handover, the rest of the team will be busy learning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We returned to the West Midlands this past weekend for another significant family party on the other side. It was wonderful to see all the family together, despite everyone getting older and calmer than the original days when I met them all, nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plans for both of us tuning 40 this year are under way too. The “blow out’ holiday is booked for Bali over Easter plus a “<em>Forty Fest</em>” party is planned for the first week of September (between both our birthdays) when we’ll be inviting <em>all</em> our family and friends for a number of music acts, food, drink and fun. It’s amazing to have so many people around us who can make this happen and we think celebrating with the masses (most our school and uni chums are also hitting "<em>the big four-oh</em>" too) just after the school summer break should be something for everyone to look forward to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Health</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Preparation for our <a href="https://www.jurassiccoastchallenge.com/the-challenge">Jurassic Coast Challenge</a> in May started this week but, as typical managers, we spent several hours merely planning out the training programme and fundraising activities. The challenge is mid-May so we’ve got 16 weeks to fit in practice walks, starting with a 15km warm-up next weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve setup JustGiving with <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/jurassicsi">individual</a> and <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/team/joblings">team</a> pages which seemed to make sense initially but, following complicated configurations, would’ve been easier as a joint page in the end. That said, a bit of healthy competition between the two of us won’t hurt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The diet log started this week in <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/profile/sijobling">MyFitnessPal</a>, recording all the meals and snacks I’ve indulged in through the days. It’s a tricky habit to get in to, especially with the adhoc drink or biscuit, but my OCD nature certainly enjoys all that extra data capture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also reached out on Twitter for <a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1217528819927654400">recommendations of food intolerance tests</a> which returned <em>record</em> responses (for quite a few months) from plenty of people, known and unknown. It’s a pleasant reminder of how powerful social media can be and what a wonderful community we have around us, but on the flip side, how many equally suffer with indigestion issues nowadays. Is it a new cause of dietary varieties or the consequence of growing awareness?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the food front, I’ve also tried to use up the remaining goodies from Christmas by making a Pannetone Pudding (hence the cover photo). I don’t normally make sweet treats in the kitchen, I’m more in to savoury, so this was a new thing for me. That said, I was quite proud of my home-made custard for moisture and it tasted pretty good. If I did it again, it would need more vanilla and nutmeg to add&nbsp;that extra flavour.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> continued in the recording studio this week with <a href="https://iamashley.co.uk/">Ashley</a> and <a href="https://www.kevincunningham.co.uk/">Kevin</a> sharing their career stories along with how they find a balance with side projects, health and personal demands. <a href="https://marclittlemore.com/">Marc</a> will be recorded next week plus one final guest needs securing and recording in the next few weeks before I start the new job. Then I can crack on with production and preparation for a February release. I really do enjoy having the conversations with the individuals; I’m normally buzzing after the sessions so, as long as I can fit this in, it'll definitely be continuing. All the guests so far are keen for follow-ups as well so I’ll have to work out how to make that happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://housefinesse.com">House Finesse</a> has been handed over to my partners-in-crime, <strong>Stu</strong> and <strong>Matt</strong>, at least for the next few months. I’m trying to keep it going as it approaches 15 years of mixes but with minimal commitment on my part as I start the new job and find my capacity.&nbsp;(There's a recurring theme here, right?)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Away from my laptop, I've also been thinking about learning more musical instruments. I'm tempted to take on the bass guitar this year, spend more time on the piano and (ideally) setup my decks in the home studio. That final one might be harder to convince my wife but she quickly offered to buy me a guitar for my 40th birthday (alongside my mid-life crisis tattoo I have planned) and I could always justify the decks as practice for a set at our "Forty Fest" party in September…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>A new section that I realised I was overlooking - quite concerning considering my line of work.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week has presented two "<em>Year In Review</em>" infographics from some of my favourite apps; <a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a> and <a href="https://untappd.com/">Untappd</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[6099,6098]} -->
<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="http://sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0406.png" alt="" data-id="6099" data-full-url="http://sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0406.png" data-link="http://sijobling.com/?attachment_id=6099" class="wp-image-6099"/><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">My #YearInMonzo</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="http://sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0442-1024x1024.png" alt="" data-id="6098" data-full-url="http://sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0442.png" data-link="http://sijobling.com/?attachment_id=6098" class="wp-image-6098"/><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">My #YearInBeer</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm not sure if should be proud or concerned that my most popular places on Monzo are my nearest takeaway and convenience store plus 56 unique beers in one year suggests one a week. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://app.hellocast.co/">HelloCast</a> has continued to impress me as I plan out and record Make Life Work. An amazing tool for gathering notes on guests and episodes, clearly made by people who know this industry (good ol' "eating dog food" at play)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've had several connectivity issues at home; one with an old WD MyBookWorld NAS drive that just doesn't seem to want to connect or be discoverable on our home network, and the new Hive cam seems to drop connection quite regularly which I suspect is due to nearby competition with The Boy's Netflix UHD streaming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of the Boy, we put his <a href="https://t.co/GyrctKMrQI?amp=1">Xbox One S on eBay</a> this weekend to fund the final part required of his new gaming PC; a graphics card. He's hoping to get at least £110 for it but we reckon it's worth around £150 if pushed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/deadwater-fell">Deadwater Fell on All4</a> has caught our attention over the past few weeks. Always loved David Tennant so it's quite refreshing seeing him play a more sinister character and in his home country. I have found it frustrating not being able to binge the entire series though respect Channel 4 for eking out the series over time properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07w07fy">Murmurs on BBC Sounds</a> - intriguing half hour stories, first one about some time travel between modern and old times, second around paranormal outcomes and third with strange happenings. Think Black Mirror crossed with X Files. I also love this use of podcasts on an influential platform, providing short stories in small, digestible forms. It would be great to see more like this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The music playlist has taken a turn back to the late-90s, early noughties where I've been revisiting some classic UK Garage and Hed Kandi on Youtube including <a href="https://youtu.be/90suQs2Z2k0">Paul Velocity's Oldskool UKG</a> mix, <a href="http://youtu.be/qQaEWVYuyXU">DJ EZ's Boiler Room x RBMA London</a> session and <a href="https://youtu.be/8q52_noWAM0">Disco Heaven 01.05</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve continued to read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1844544613/">Red Herrings and White Elephants</a>, discovering the origins of everyday idioms. Here’s some of my recent favourites:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>“<em>Don't let the bastards grind you down</em>" - that naughty word actually references a 17th century carpentry tool called a <em>bastard file</em>, a coarse file used as a heavy-handed way to grind something down for finer touch-ups.&nbsp;</li><li>“<em>Cock and bull story</em>” derives from Stony Stratford – a nearby town almost central between London, Birmingham, Cambridge and Oxford – which has two coaching inns, <em>The Cock</em> and <em>The Bull</em>, who tried to outdo each other with exciting travelling tales.&nbsp;</li><li>"<em>Murphy's Law</em>" hails from an old Air Force engineer called Edward Murphy who, as part of his investigations into airline accidents, highlighted all the obvious mistakes made which the project manager at the time coined as <em>Murphy's Laws</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><em>WeekNotes #4 brings a 21km practice walk, tattoos, tooth fairies, Comic Con, roadmaps, group fitness, F1 Calendar, more Make Life Work, NFC apps, money management, PayPal woes, Smart homes, Cold Feet, Jumanji and podcast inspiration.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Life</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prep began for the big Jurassic Coast (walking) Challenge this past weekend with our first practice walk. 21km around surrounding villages, through different terrain and damp weather. Seriously proud of ourselves, especially considering it didn’t kill us, just tightened muscles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diet tracking has taken a turn for the worse as I just couldn’t get in to the habit of recording all the food through my day, especially the home-made and takeaway specials. Following my chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcLittlemore">Marc</a> on Friday though, I want to see how his habit tracker could be adjusted to suit me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mid-life crisis continues with finding inspiration for suitable tattoo artwork. I've had it in my mind for months to cover up the existing Chinese symbol on my upper right arm with something more meaningful to me. A visit to a local tattoo shop gave me plenty ideas although I need to improve my Google Fu when searching. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Princess lost her first baby tooth this week (at the tender age of 7½ as well) to much fanfare. But what’s the current exchange rate for teeth? It turns out the <a href="https://www.dentalreview.news/knowledge/65-dentistry-white-papers/3922-tooth-fairy-uk-rates">averages fluctuate around the UK</a>, from 50p up to £20! It looks like the tooth fairy went for the safe £2 in our region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re also planning our ComicCon visit for this year, probably heading over to the <a href="https://www.walescomiccon.com/">“Welsh” gathering (in Telford)</a> for a change of scenery. There’s a mix of themes to play with though; The Boy is keen on <em>Stranger Things</em> but Princess on <em>His Dark Materials</em>. I’m considering the former so I can go for the “simpler” Jim Hopper cop with handlebar moustache.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The countdown is on with just a few weeks left at ASOS. All the handovers and 121’s required before my final week (when my replacement is on holiday) so we had to condense in as much as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before I parted ways, I was keen to help the team identify their vision and roadmap for the next few quarters. I used personas as a foundation, grouping people up to “become” the personas and note down three topics based on <em>emotions</em>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><em>What are you currently thinking/doing/feeling?</em> &#x1f914;</li><li><em>What would you love to see?</em> &#x1f970;</li><li><em>What would annoy you?</em> &#x1f644;</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each group then discussed their outputs with the wider group, organising and visualising on a wall, which were then aggregated and prioritised together. As we discussed the common areas, other topics came up which we captured as extra “discovery” topics. We then went through the currently planned roadmap to see what overlapped (it helps align with business commitments and decisions) then volunteers claimed the feature they were most passionate about to encourage ownership and responsibility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not just about the management though; we had one last “Boyband” reunion (which I referred to <a href="http://sijobling.com/blog/team-building-workouts/">the benefits of last year</a>). Emotional times as the boys battled through some seriously tough workouts yet they were still capable of lifting me at the end for a posing shot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m not the only one leaving ASOS at the moment; a chat group with a friend who’s leaving and another approaching 10 years definitely highlighted how things have changed over the years (some for good, some not as much). We were reflecting on the situation 6 years ago before the unbelievable growth through some tough times. I’m hoping that “startup” feel is still evident in my new gig –&nbsp;one of the attractive factors –&nbsp;but, after recent investment from a Cantonese organisation, I need to be ready for some challenging times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://f1calendar.com/">F1 Calendar “2020 Edition”</a> was released at the start of the week to controlled fanfare (and minimal pain). Amazing effort from Andy Y to get this out the door before the season starts and initial metrics look like it’s still serving an awesome audience. <em>Side note:</em> waking up to <a href="https://github.com/sportstimes/f1/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">PRs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sportstimes/f1/graphs/commit-activity">deployment notifications</a> with Andy’s California timezone are seriously throwing me. (It’ll be another adjustment as I join WorldFirst.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make. Life. Work.</a> series 2 recordings are now in the can following chats with <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcLittlemore">Marc</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/danjdavies">Dan D</a>. I’ve got one more lined up for next week with <a href="https://twitter.com/iiCe89">Daniel V</a> giving me one extra for this round (despite throwing out the gender ratio).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also recorded a load of videos to create a “<em>Making of…</em>” series to support the project. It started off as a blog draft when I realised (a) there’s loads to cover so I should break it down and (b) video content might be more engaging for this topic. Production is still under way as I find a house style I’m happy with but it’s been great getting feedback from my <a href="https://ontheside.network">On The Side</a> acquaintances to shape it better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two iOS apps have impressed me this week for completely different reasons:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://readid.com/">ReadID NFC</a> is super useful to validate NFC identity documents. My wife’s passport wasn’t scanning correctly on the return from France a few weeks back so we started the replacement process (along with the pain of capturing a passport friendly photo on her phone). After a little Googling, I tested her passport with this app which proved it’s fine. Much cheaper than £80!</li><li><a href="https://www.yolt.com/">Yolt</a> is a brilliant app for monitoring your current, savings and credit accounts in one aggregate view thanks to <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">Open Banking</a>. Since I’ve setup a number of online current accounts such as Monzo, Starling and Revolut, I’ve been curious where my spending habits are going. UX is delightful and, so far, no issues. Encouraging and enlightening…</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Boy’s Xbox One S was snapped up last week (at the <em>Buy It Now</em> price too), however, that didn’t come without issues. For some reason, an old PayPal account I created for a family member received the funds which was on lock-down for 3 weeks and incapable of access despite all the security mechanisms and answers. Luckily, I was able to issue a refund directly to the buyer but now it needs rectifying so we can ship that out and order the graphics card.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After putting it off for years, I’ve finally ordered an <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00U57TQ7Q/">SSD dock</a> for the replacement drive in my 2012 iMac. The original drive is just completely dead so I want to get it up-and-running with a basic 128GB SSD and see how difficult it actually is to replace a drive. I’ve nothing to lose though; it’s been sitting there like an ornament for the past 2 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since getting an individual Philips Hue bulb for Christmas, it’s been rendered quite useless so far apart from the novelty of changing the brightness from my phone. I finally ordered a <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7944420">Hub with extra bulbs</a> this weekend so I’ll be having fun setting that up next week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/deadwater-fell">Deadwater Fell</a> has continued to entertain us with David Tennant’s seriously intense character. </li><li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ct7b">Trial of Christine Keeler</a> concluded with some unexpected twists at the end. Brilliant performance from James Norton (<em>not <a href="https://twitter.com/nortools">that</a> one</em>) - he is definitely one to watch!</li><li><a href="https://www.itv.com/hub/cold-feet/1a2292">Cold Feet</a> recently returned for another series which we still enjoy - the UK’s “Friends” as we described it to The Boy.</li><li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7975244/">Jumanji: The Next Level</a> lived up to expectations, that is a dreadful remake and extension of the latest franchise. I’m not sure what I’m more disappointed by; the lack of story or the fact The Rock doesn’t appear to age.</li><li>Roman Mars’ <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a> and Elizabeth Elcoate’s <a href="https://theelasticbrand.com/">The Elastic Brand </a>have now entered my podcatcher, both for interesting content and inspiration for Make. Life. Work. </li><li><a href="http://youtu.be/roQuEqxjDx4">Folamour's DJ Mag set</a> is a delightful disco/funk/soul mix and a wonder to watch as he enjoys his music.</li><li>The Shapeshifters new track "Second Chance" with Kimberly Davis has been on loop since <a href="https://defected.com/music/radio">Defected Radio Shows</a> have been hammering it out to build up interest. It's working, guys!</li></ul>

<p><em>Week 5 of 2020 brings generous colleagues on the final day at ASOS, muscles, Make Life Work video snippets, gaming PCs, Apple Express Transit, Byte, The Vision, Little Boots &amp; Shrill.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was my last week at ASOS (#<em>AllTheFeels</em>). Seriously though, after working in one place for over 6 years, spending the majority of weekdays with these people, I've made some fantastic friends (not just colleagues). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I drafted my leaving message, it made me realise how many people have been on the journey with me. From starting in the Birmingham office (with just 3 others for company), shifting to London on a number of different teams, help grow the Web platform to over 60 people and nurture a number of cross-cutting initiatives including community meetups, <em>ASOS Tech</em>'s online brand, <em>Families in Tech</em> and much more. I was over the moon to see my request for donations to the <a href="https://justgiving.com/jurassicsi">Jurassic Coast Challenge for Mind</a> rather than silly gifts raised nearly £350 for the charity. What lovely and generous people! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final day was naturally a difficult day, not helped by a stinking hangover from the previous evening's leaving drinks, but that didn't stop me wrapping up on a high. Our monthly Tech Develops returned and, with it, I encouraged two of my engineers to present work to peers as part of their personal objectives. It was testament to the individuals when one talk was sold out and in high demand (take 2 is planned for next month) and the other showed encouraging signs for more collaboration across engineering teams. I feel like my work here is done! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, I start my new adventure at <a href="https://www.worldfirst.com">WorldFirst</a>. With just one day to rest and recoup, I'm super-keen to get started and understand what my objectives will be. A cheeky email to my new manager this week suggests I'll be flexing my Jira skills pulling together suitable dashboards and reports for teams to get visibility of focus and delivery. Looking forward to that. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With it being my final week at ASOS, I was also keen to make the most of the free gym and subsidised personal training so squeezed in three sessions amongst all the final bits of work. The personal trainer did give me encouraging signs though to suggest all the fitness is paying off as my strength has improved quite substantially this year, in weights and physique.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm now on the hunt for an alternative gym to keep this fitness bug going. There are a couple options around London near the new office block at Millbank Tower or some around my home train station in Rugby. I don't want to commit to another £50 subscription (as is typical) so will be looking for either a reduced price or PAYG model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> was the main focus for side projects this week. I managed to create a snappy video title sequence for the <em>Making Of...</em> series, pulling together clips from the Skype video calls we used to record the sessions. However, I naively forgot to get clearance from all the guests of the podcast which came as a bit of a shock for some of them to see their faces in the sequence. I quickly pulled the teaser from Twitter and reconsidered the approach, even though most people were understanding after some reactive conversations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've also continued recording the twice daily voice notes as part of my commute to and from the train station (or start and end of day when working from home). I'm keen to rebrand it under the Verbal Diary guise (seeing as that was the original intent) but it could get confusing if we ever revive the podcast with James so, after learning from the mistake of the title sequence before, I might put a pin in that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The biggest tech achievement of the week (ne life) was completing the build of The Boy's new gaming PC. After selling his Xbox One and resolving the Paypal issues, we got the graphics card delivered, installed and the machine seemed to work first time amazingly. The satisfaction on his face gave me such joy but, secretly, I was also quite proud of myself for (a) helping him and (b) coaching him to think about the process without speeding ahead as a typical Gen Z.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, I tried swapping my Apple Watch from left wrist to right to see how it feels. The reason for this was to prepare for <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/transport/">Apple Express Transit payments on the London Tube</a> when I start using them next week. It also prompted a Twitter poll which suggests I'm not alone in using my non-dominant wrist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/twitter -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notable apps of the week include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Very </em>early preview of a coaching app an (ex) ASOS colleague is currently alpha testing with fellow "emotionally intelligent" coaches</li><li><a href="https://www2.meethue.com/en-gb/app/bridge">Philips Hue</a> now that my smart bulbs are finally connected to a Hub, it just needs some configuration with HomeKit, Alexa etc</li><li><a href="https://byte.co/">byte </a>- the latest attempt at a social video network by the creator of Vine which I can't say has caught my attention but at least I’ve secured my <em>sijobling </em>moniker, disappointed it doesn’t support 2-letter usernames.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DefectedRecords/videos/481895242749061/">The Vision’s “<em>Mountains</em>” (Danny Krivit Edit)</a> is a fabulous follow-up to last year’s Heaven, continuing with Andreya Triana’s wonderful vocals on their infectious loops and quality production. Must buy (when it’s available)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoFvwW1T0fA">Little Boots disco set in The Lab for Mixmag</a> is a delightful mix by an unknown DJ (to me) who has some serious skills - and I’m always up for highlighting a decent female DJ to fight back the male-dominant market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p07vzgp0/shrill-series-1-1-annie">Shrill</a> is a fantastic US comedy series we recently discovered on BBC iPlayer about a young journalist who goes through some difficult times challenging the status quo, using her image to her advantage. I love her persona along with the relationships with British house-mate and work hubby. </p>

<p><em>Week 6 of 2020 brings a new job, unused gym memberships, Ferrite, merging cloud storage woes, Windows shortcuts, TfL Contactless data, Purple Disco Machine, Man Like Mobeen, Ghostbusters and freelancer idioms.</em> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was my first week at <a href="https://www.worldfirst.com/">WorldFirst</a>; my first company change since 2013! Needless to say I was full of excitement, energy &amp; anxiety, wondering what to expect from the company, the team and the role. The first few days were energy draining. I was thrown into a few projects to get a better understanding and improve communication (typical NDA's hold me back from sharing the exact details) but it was fascinating to see how they operate at an international level and what the internal teams have done so far.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was also tasked with documenting the basics of agile delivery to guide our teams how we should strive to operate across all the engineering squads. I spent a few days understanding the status quo but also noting down my recommendations from personal experiences. It's been enlightening to compare models between two different companies but also highlight the differences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What really caught my attention was all the pleasant extras WorldFirst offer employees to make you enjoy your working environment; every Tuesday newstarters take a chocolate trolley around the office to meet new people, the kitchen is full of breakfast goodies and snacks to keep you going through the day and the classic Friday beers are available from 4:30pm. My desk view across London is phenomenal too (hence the feature cover image) but it's taking some adjustment with the additional daily Tube journey from Euston to Pimlico. I still make it to the office for 8:30am though to hook up with our Chinese counterparts. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the new job, I'm slowly adjusting to a new routine but I did  manage to squeeze in a swim Monday (the one day off between jobs) and Saturday with the kids, plus I also signed up to a local Rugby gym on a £5 month trial. I've not had the chance to try it out yet with evening commutes but plan to get down there a few times next week with things settling down.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides 
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> editing finally began using a new iPad app, Ferrite<strong> </strong>(see <a href="#Tech">Tech</a> below), starting with <a href="https://brandedbynaomi.com/">Naomi White</a>'s conversation. As the first session of the series, we used a Skype call to capture audio for convenience but it's definitely more tricky to trim, edit and level when using a single audio track. I'm glad subsequent guests recorded locally which I'll continue to encourage on future episodes.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also realised this week most my "successful" projects are results of community efforts; <a href="https://housefinesse.com">House Finesse </a>with Stu and Matt; <a href="https://twitter.com/derbycounty">Derby County</a> with Franca, Simon and co; <a href="https://f1calendar.com/">F1 Calendar</a> with Andy, Brian and Andy. It definitely helps surrounding yourself with people who can help bounce ideas and challenge you in ways. Having <a href="http://sijobling.com/portfolio/on-the-side/">OnTheSide</a> to help with <em>Make Life Work </em>certainly has.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="Tech">Tech
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/">Ferrite</a> - the most expensive iOS app I've ever bought (£28) but it <em>should </em>be used enough to justify the cost. The UX is so natural to anyone who's edited audio before and it appears to offer all the basics to produce a good sounding podcast. We'll see as I use it more. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm in the process of trying to consolidate my online subscriptions, starting with migrating Dropbox to iCloud. I'm currently paying for 2TB plans on both which neither are touching the sides so it makes sense to merge the two. However, there doesn't appear to be an easy way to transfer files from one to the other <em>online</em> so it looks like a painful manual process.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the new job, I've been given a Windows(!) laptop until the new stock of Apple Macs are available. It gives me all the tools I need to work (mostly Web-based) but retraining my brain to the other keyboard shortcuts is proving difficult. It's amazing how familiar you get after 14 years of the Apple eco-system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Commuting on the London Underground, I was keen to use Apple Wallet on my Watch for tapping in and out of stations. It generally works but I've noticed on the <a href="https://contactless.tfl.gov.uk/">TfL Contactless website</a> each day has a different instance of the same (Barclays) account making it trickier to monitor aggregate costs. Has anyone else noticed this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Purple Disco Machine</strong> returns with another infectious disco tip "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q_Xse4izH8">In Your Arms</a>", due out soon and bound to be on most house DJ's playlists for the Summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Man Like Mobeen</strong> returns for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p080f7dd/man-like-mobeen-series-3-1-you-reap-what-you-sow">Series 3</a> on BBC - love the real Brummy edge (unlike Peaky Blinders) but respect to the reality check of gang culture not being glorified.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80990849">The Movies That Made Us</a> on Netflix is a great trip down Nostalgia Cul-de-Sac, reminiscing over the biggest movies of the 80's; how Ghostbusters was made on a tight deadline with endless curve balls and how Home Alone struggled with funding from Warner Bros and realising how the bonus cam provided better results which they discussed about using in their dailies (faster feedback FTW!)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've also tried to finish off <strong>Red Herrings &amp; White Elephants </strong>to close my first book of 2020; here were some of my favourite origin stories:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Off the cuff</em> - Victorian times when speakers tried to talk without notes but did, in fact, write notes on their shirt cuffs before and during dinners.  </li><li><em>Freelancer</em> - originated from Middle Ages as a lance soldier available for hire.  </li></ul>

<p><em>Week 7 of 2020 brings inspiring tasty moments in the new job, Valentine's curry, Green campaigning, more On The Side people, yet another digital bank, Harley Quinn and boozy idioms.</em> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second week at WorldFirst and still loving it.  Finding a better balance with remote working days, typically one day a week from home (so far it's been Fridays but considering Thursday next week to mix it up). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A range of projects to focus on is challenging me (in a good way), especially with shifting priorities, but having a number of different things to work on is giving me plenty opportunity to get around the company and meet people.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On that note, Tuesday was fun; every week, newstarters are asked to take a trolley of treats around the office to introduce yourself to colleagues. I naturally jumped at the chance to meet new faces but messed up by visiting my home floor second with a lot less stock (they were very vocal about this).  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My new line manager is smashing it out the park too. She's an inspiration with the way she handles some extremely awkward conversations, our first one-to-one was about objectives, sharing her own and asking me to consider something personal over shared team/competency goals, and she's constantly checking in to make sure all is good. Coincidentally, <a href="https://twitter.com/Natty_Huitson">Nat</a> text me the other day about some personal problems and how I was always concerned about people I managed, clearly a relevant skill to be mindful of. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>School's out on half term for the rest of the family but that means very little to me, just being more quiet in the morning when leaving for work.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Boy had a mental wellbeing life skills day at school which presented some interesting topics including sex education with plasticine, mouling vulvas and being perplexed by the variety of shapes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Valentines Day came on Friday, something we try not to make too much a fuss of (#LoveIsntCommercialism) but both of us end feeling guilty the night before and end up grabbing some impulse junk. Nice excuse for a few bottles of decent wine and food though and we decided to take the kids out for a curry at our favourite Indian restaurant in Rugby, <a href="http://titashrugby.co.uk/">Titash</a>.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've also started preparation for my local political efforts as a non-standing candidate for the Green Party. I'm equally excited and nervous about the prospect of this but it is something I get incrementally passionate about every time I talk to someone about it. It's not about me though - it's about the bigger picture, the planet and improving local culture to support a sustainable future for my children and their generation.  Check out my WIP "<a href="http://sijobling.com/vote/">campaign</a>" page for more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first episode of <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> series two is now done, ready for a preview with guest <a href="https://brandedbynaomi.com/">Naomi White</a>. It was wonderful going through our conversation again after nearly a month since recording. I'm also mindful of how much time I spend editing to what I call the "<em>Nicholas Parsons</em>" effect; no hesitations, repetitions or deviations (in memory of the host of Radio 4 comedy show, Just A Minute - another blog post in the making).  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://ontheside.network/">On The Side</a> has been quite active this past week too. Regular <a href="https://twitter.com/thehodge">Dom Hodgson</a> helped me grow the community a little as we welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/rhyswynne">Rhys</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alunr">Alan</a> to the fold where they've shared their side project stories. Co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/brussells">Ben</a> also returned after a break, finding the solution to a painful long problem he was having on some UE4 collision physics.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Health
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I managed to visit <a href="https://www.xercise4less.co.uk/">Xercise4Less</a> on Tuesday - the new gym I signed up for in Rugby. It's not quite the same as ASOS with the number of people in there and less engaged staff but there's plenty equipment to use and some 99p fitness plans customised to individuals. Their app is quite impressive too so I'll be returning next week, hopefully for two sessions.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some new apps I've been playing with this week;
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.xercise4less.co.uk/app/">Xercise4less</a> (as mentioned before) has some impressive UX, conveniently connected to Apple Health for synchronising any workouts (not just in their guns) </li><li><a href="https://www.curve.com/">Curve</a> is another online only bank I've signed up for, this time because it's a clever aggregator for all other banks (thanks to <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">Open Banking</a>). The USP for shifting transactions between accounts is quite handy too (such as work-related budgets on one card and allowing the kids to borrow a Contacless card for convenience) </li><li><a href="https://www.dingtalk.com/">Dingtalk</a> is the preferred chat app for work so I've been adapting to that platform where possible. Nowhere near as user-friendly as Slack or Teams but, with Alibaba support, it's always good to "eat dog food".  </li><li><a href="https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/">Ferrite</a> (as mentioned last week) has proved really useful for editing audio in a seamless workflow. It seems to be quite battery intensive though, using about 20% of my iPad Pro 12.9" with 45 minutes usage.  </li></ul>

<p>I've also been configuring an old iPhone and Windows PC for my daughter. I was a little reluctant to do this but her viewing habits and photos were mixing up with mine which can be a little awkward when sharing with friends and confusing recommendations. <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/families/">Apple Family</a>, <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/about?ru=https:%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Ffamily">Microsoft Family</a> and <a href="https://families.google.com/intl/en_uk/familylink/">Google Family Link</a> definitely come in useful for enforcing limits, monitoring behaviours but sharing suitable content together. Her first text to me whilst shopping highlighted her Brummie phonetics (despite being born-and-bred in Northampton): </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7713068/">Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey</a> from WB/DC was an enjoyable escapism action movie with some female antagonists to hold the fort. Nothing clever (like most comic conversions) but great performance from Margot and wonderful to see a dominant female force on the production side too. The trailers for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2177538/">Ghostbusters: Afterlife</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7126948/">Wonder Woman 1984</a> also kept our eighties addiction on tender hooks.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I finished Red Herrings this week, a few more idioms caught my attention worth sharing;
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>"<em>To good health</em>" harks from the 19th century cholera outbreak in London when Dr John Snow (not that one) suggested it was linked to the local well water so people drank alcohol instead.  </li><li>"<em>Minding your P's and Q's</em>" is another classic alcohol origin whereby bartenders would keep <em>tabs</em> under the bar of drinks with P for "pints" and Q for "quarts" (two pints) and customers were advised to check them at the end of the night.</li><li>"<em>Warts and all</em>" is from Oliver Cromwell's days when artists typically "air-brushed" portraits of their models but Cromwell instructed his artist to break convention, highlighting a wart on his chin.  </li></ul>

<p><em>Week 8 of 2020 brings forming teams, agile delivery models, beardy tattoos, London tourism, series 2 of Make Life Work, more open-sourcery, disappointing apps and plenty classics remixed.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We formed a new team this week to work on an upcoming piece of work which I always find enjoyable, especially getting to know the individual personalities, strengths and quirks along with the team dynamics. As is tradition, we setup an initial Ways Of Working (WoW) session to understand the basics such as ideal workflow, team meetings and code quality. I typically try to inject some humour to keep the mood positive as well, suggesting the very important topics of team names and the first team lunch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking at the bigger picture, we've also been brainstorming a "toolkit" to suggest best practices for all engineering teams. Early stages are encouraging and it will need plenty iteration with user testing but it's quite satisfying (<em>a</em>) bouncing ideas around on a whiteboard with fellow agile enthusiasts <em>focused on delivery</em> and (<em>b</em>) finding common patterns that <em>could</em> scale appropriately. We’re also trying to practice what we preach by adopting the principles on the project itself. #meta</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As my 40th birthday fast approaches, I've been thinking about some things I'd like to do "<em>before I'm forty</em>" (a blog post I've had in mind since turning 30!)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>A new tattoo covering up the tragic Chinese symbol on my upper arm from when I was 24; at least a half sleeve, but with something that should age better and mean more to me.</li><li><span style="font-size: inherit;">The beard is growing thicker and longer each week, to the delight of my wife and son but not my daughter. I'm going for the "wise old man" look rather than hipster but that's lost in translation with my general appearance.</span></li><li>I've got a second-hand bass guitar on my wishlist in an attempt to learn it. I'd love to sit and play some classic (disco) riffs alongside the family piano and, oddly, my wife is quite encouraging.   </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Health</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, I ventured into The City for some much-needed exercise. There's a run club at work I've been keen to try since starting the job. It turns out the current route takes us past Parliament, Big Ben (wrapped in scaffolding), Buckingham Palace and many other tourist traps which certainly make for a more enjoyable jog. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also tried a cycle hire from Euston to the office on Friday morning, partly to save costs but also to test the estimated 20 minute journey. The first attempt definitely didn't meet that expectation but, now I know the route and quirks of docking stations, it's definitely worth another attempt in the near future. (<em>Pro tip: it's not the buses you need to watch out for but the seasoned cyclists who seem to think they own the cycle paths</em>.) </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further practice for the <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/jurassicsi">Jurassic Coast Challenge in May</a> has returned this week with a brisk Sunday morning 13km walk from Rugby back home. We do need to find a more enjoyable route or two though; it's not the most relaxing scenery walking through industrial estates towards the motorway. MapMyWalk has surfaced a few crowd-sourced suggestions that circle around home so we'll give them a go over coming weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work series 2</a> starts this week with <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/naomi-white/">Naomi White taking the limelight</a>. Last week, I spent some time tidying up the edit, preparing a sponsorship message for <a href="https://littlewarden.com/makelifework">Little Warden</a> and sorting the updated artwork template out. The podcast itself also needed a bit of house-keeping including the removal of the full-stops from the name (to hopefully improve discoverability in search engines following some user feedback).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To support the series, I've also prepared some "<em>Making Of</em>" Youtube videos along with a suitable title sequence for all the episodes. Following the first attempt with no clearance from guests to use our video call footage, I've opted for approved avatars adopting the duo-tone colour palette for branding. Definitely an improvement and snappier too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://ontheside.network/">On The Side</a> has been a little quiet this past week but we've also setup a <a href="https://github.com/on-the-side/website">Github project</a> to host a simple landing page. At the moment, it's simply a Github Pages site using the README but we'll probably change it to a static HTML page to allow further customisations.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, I've encourage my wife to get writing her novel by setting up a <a href="https://astrallariat.com/">basic landing page</a> along with the necessary socials. Very early days but it was a good chance to reserve the <a href="https://twitter.com/astrallariat">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/astrallariat">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/astrallariat">Instagram</a> accounts and connect them with a Mailchimp newsletter "VIP" list to start building an audience. It's amazing how many friends and family "like" your Facebook page when you ask nicely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Microsoft’s new <a href="https://products.office.com/en-gb/mobile/office-mobile-apps-for-ios">Office app for iPhone</a> looks promising as a centralised place to work with popular doc formats. Frustrating that it’s just iPhone to start with though (although I respect they’ve gone MLP on the roll-out)</li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/santander-cycles/id974792287">Santander’s Cycle Hire app</a> for TfL is a waste of time. Registration failed with techy JSON error messages and I had no way to restore my account. Avoid at all costs and be careful with Contactless payments at the docking bays too which appears to have double-charged me.</li><li>I was hoping <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-studio/id888530356">YouTube Studio for iOS</a> would give me some tools for making videos but it’s mostly for managing your content and meta data. Back to the drawing board to find a way of editing 6-8GB video files on a 32GB iPad…</li><li><a href="https://justpark.mention-me.com/m/ol/pd3qr-simon-jobling">JustPark</a> has come to the rescue though again, offering cheaper parking in London with a seamless user experience and friendly regular comms from the lady near Brent Cross when the family fancied a half-term day out this week.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/baghdad-central">Baghdad Central on All4</a> looks like a gritty drama based around the early days of Sadam Hussein's fall in Irag circa 2003. It's always fascinating to see it from another perspective too. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the holiday/party season fast approaches, as does the amount of decent house music. It's not all brand new though; 20th anniversary of Madison Avenue's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-qE-h7s84">Don't Call Me Baby</a>" has surfaced some cracking remixes from <a href="https://www.beatport.com/track/dont-call-me-baby-mousse-t-remix/12689619">Mousse T.</a> and <a href="https://www.beatport.com/track/dont-call-me-baby-super-disco-club-remix/12689620">Super Disco</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnzu7jnoTKo">Alan Fitzpatrick</a> has brought Patrice Rushden up to date and Donna Allen has got reworked by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i84eD3EKEEQ">Alaia &amp; Gallo</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://mockerymanor.podomatic.com">Mockery Manor</a> is a great podcast recommended by Stephen Fry - it’s wonderful to see the technology used to share different art-forms and I love how we’re getting more fiction coming through from independent makers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I visited a takeaway/restaurant near work called <a href="https://tosseduk.com/">Tossed</a>; tasty international food, keto friendly and also trying to encourage reusable containers - but plastic cutlery!? </p>

<p><em>Week 9 of 2020 brings COVID-19-WFH, short-term gym memberships, Naomi White, Nicholas Parsons, new old tech, The Stranger, George Benson and iPad banter.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, we took a number of key technical, product and commercial people off-site for a brainstorming workshop on upcoming work, to validate ideas and agree the prioritisation of work. It was a great opportunity to understand the different skills and personas in the team but also for me to flex some facilitation muscles keeping people focused, productive and accountable to the day’s goals. <em>Pro tip</em>: a physical countdown timer (as featured above) really helps organise this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the growing fear of COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) across the globe, it’s at the back of everyone’s mind what that means for co-located teams in London. Our colleagues in Hong Kong and China have already been adapting to remote working (which I gather is not as normal in Asian markets), we’re starting to see more and more people across the tech teams being put into domestic quarantine. As someone who constantly encourages face-to-face communication but also appreciates the occasional day of remote working, it’s going to be a challenge to ensure teams are collaborating and delivering but also managing expectations with stakeholders with contingencies around estimations and delivery dates.</p>

<p>After an unsuccessful second visit to the new gym, I’ve now cancelled my membership. It was a combination of intimidation and capacity that confirmed my actions. I don’t like to be beaten that easily but I wasn’t tolerating unsociable behaviour (from other members mostly) and reality is I’ve just not got the energy at the end of long days in London. I do need to sort something else out though before dad bod takes over.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further training for the Jurassic Coast Challenge continued this weekend too; a relatively mild 10km around nearby villages but, this time, accompanied by The Boy. He was definitely lagging as we approached the “pub stop” in Swinford so we agreed to call it a day and get a taxi home. Worth noting Uber is not a feasible service in remote villages; the “nearest” driver was over 10miles away in Leicester.</p>

<p><a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> started again this week with <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/naomi-white/">Naomi’s episode</a> going out on Monday. Early numbers are promising although I’ve not had much feedback yet. I’ve continued to push comms across socials this time, not just limiting it to Twitter but trying Instagram and Facebook as well. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/zjUvqiyIqhY">first part</a> of the <em>Making Of</em> video series is also a channel I’ll be trying to improve engagement but that might be more of a slow burner. I’m also considering publishing all the series archives to YouTube in a batch once it concludes for “binge listening” (and archiving purposes).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve also tried setting up <a href="https://www.patreon.com/makelifework">a Patreon page</a> to support the Make Life Work podcast. This is not with a commercial angle but an attempt to raise more funds for Mind charity as I drive that publicity out. The only package available at the moment is early access (24 hours before release) but I will be exploring more ways to encourage patrons that aren’t too expensive, maybe shipping out stickers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In producing Make Life Work, I’ve also observed a technique that I thought was worthy of an actual blog post, <a href="http://sijobling.com/blog/nicholas-parsons-technique/">The Nicholas Parsons Technique</a>. Scarily enough, it’s nearly a whole year since <a href="http://sijobling.com/blog/team-building-workouts/">my last proper blog post</a> but it does beg the question; do WeekNotes or podcast episodes count?</p>

<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>iPhone 4 is back in the house!</strong> Mrs J’s iPhone 6S Plus has been randomly burning up without any usage so, following a quick assessment at Carphone Warehouse and fun syncing as much as possible with iCloud before overheating, we’ve initiated a service with Apple Care. In the mean time, I picked up a second hand iPhone 4 from CEX for £30 so she could stay online. Certainly a simpler experience on the original screen size. I’m quite amazed that <a href="https://messenger.com/">Messenger</a> and WhatsApp both still work on the old specs of iOS 9 though (despite me trying to avoid them both).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After struggling to focus on some decent literature away from screens, I’ve decided to take the plunge with a Kindle. I desperately want to get more reading under my belt – that 10 book 2020 goal on Goodreads is looking very unlikely so far. With the upcoming trip to Bali, I’ll have plenty more time to relax with a book plus I don’t fancy lugging around loads of printed material (although I do prefer the feeling of paper and dog-ears over digital).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our <a href="https://Justgiving.com/jurassicsi">Jurassic Coast Challenge donation page</a> has now been “merged”; after speaking with Justgiving support, they suggested we either try joining them together with Teams (no joy) or just cancelling one and adding the funds “offline” to the main one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81001209">The Stranger on Netflix</a> is an interesting thriller series with so many twists and turns to keep you thinking. The production value and acting was really annoying me though; most of the roles just didn’t seem believable (except the brilliant Paul Kaye). I wish I’d read the original novel instead. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/glitterboxibiza">Glitterbox Radio Show</a> had an amazing episode last week when Melvo managed to bag an interview with the legend, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/glitterbox-radio-show-152/id120107389?i=1000466650985">George Benson</a>. Hearing his stories about some of his classics was delightful and a reminder that not all music artists are as disposable as nowadays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/adapt">Adapt podcast</a> with Federico Viticci and Ryan Christoffel caught my attention on Twitter this week as they try to “explore new ways of doing things with their favourite device” - the iPad.</p>

<p><em>Week 10 of 2020 brings merge conflicts with teams, multipack reunion, joys of education, Kevin Cunningham, On The Side growth, Intelligence, This Country and Sex Education.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve had fun with the teams recently, trying to find some standardised approaches to delivery that work across a range of Scrum, Kanban and “Scrumban” approaches. The natural choice would be to focus on <strong>throughput</strong> (number of items completed) and <strong>cycle time </strong>(how long it takes to start and complete an item) but one of the biggest challenges in our teams is planning across them so we’ve encouraged <strong>story points</strong> (sometimes known as “Planning Poker” where teams come to a consensus of how relatively complex a piece of work is in Fibonacci numbers) with two week iterations. Most teams were welcomE to the suggestions (naturally with a little friction) but this week we’ll be going through the metrics to plan for next sprint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a large project in-flight with six teams, I’ve also looked to centralise the team demos into a single condensed point, for multiple outcomes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Create a safe environment to share and praise each other on their achievements in a wider group.</strong> There can be some duplication of work or isolated pockets of knowledge we want to reduce so this should reduce that challenge.</li><li><strong>Our stakeholders only need to find time for one session.</strong> These people are often busy so struggle to make all demos. Having one session to attend should improve this.</li><li><strong>Improve social culture.</strong> Some teams are great at lunching together but there’s not much cross-team socialising. I’ve arranged demos for 11am Friday morning which nicely takes us to lunch time.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, I caught up with the “old guard” of <a href="https://multipack.co.uk/london">The Multipack</a> after years of failing to reunite in the Midlands. We realised recently that (coincidentally) many of us are working in or around Westminster. After a quick Twitter group DM thread, we set the date and location for a much-needed catch up over beer and pizza. It was wonderful to see everyone, especially learning all about how GDS / DoE / DoJ do agile ways of working from Matt and Paul. We’ll definitely be doing it again in a few months time so, if you’re reading this and would like to join, let us know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the point of education, I attended The Boy’s parents evening at school this week. He’s doing a brilliant job, all teachers were full of praise with his ability, delivery and enthusiasm. I was, however, perplexed by the new GCSE Computer Science course. Content seems adequate, covering a good range of theory and practical coding (in Python). However, the assessment threw me. There is no coursework contributing towards final grades, just two 2-hour exams which one consists of <em>handwriting code on paper</em>. I’m not sure who and why this was considered but it certainly doesn’t reflect the real world of tech for me. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fitness has definitely taken a turn for the worse recently through a combination of timing and conditions. I’m struggling to fit in training in the evenings now and lunch-time efforts were squandered by constant damp rain and rising fears of coronavirus around London.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> continues this week with <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/kevin-cunningham/">Kevin Cunningham’s episode</a>. It was wonderful to talk to Kevin about the education system, the joy of learning and how he switched from teaching through agency work to freelance web development. Analytics suggest it’s engaged well already but that might also be to increased marketing for the podcast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to continue the video series about why and how I make the podcast but struggled to find time amongst reduced commuting time (working remotely two days). Looking at the introduction video again, I realised it didn’t give much to go on so maybe another part will help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also introduced a few new members to <a href="http://sijobling.com/portfolio/on-the-side/">On The Side</a> last week; Jay George (who I know quite well), Simon Hearne and Charlotte H (who heard about it through Make Life Work). It’s lovely to see organic growth in the community like that but also with occasional relevant tweets that seem to engage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve not explored much new tech this past week, mainly continued to flex my muscles in Ferrite for producing the podcast. I accidentally discovered a neat little UX for splitting tracks with a single swipe down gesture which definitely improved my productivity. I’d love it if I could work out how to quick remove blocks though as that generally takes 4 touches which I could simplify with a single key stroke or gesture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have been wondering about how I could stream Disney Plus and Apple TV+ content to the family TV this week. The obvious choice is an Apple TV device but, before splashing out £150 on a new one, I’m looking at alternative options like Lightning-HDMI adapters for iPhone/iPad or any second-hand devices (I’m all for recycling devices if they work).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/title/series/02d6f8bd-1298-4cb6-8c8b-f83c33a43f6e/intelligence">Intelligence on Sky</a> with David Schwimmer is a fun series, based around GCHQ and Schwander seconded in from the NSA. The differences between the UK and US are emphasised by very funny to watch - but it does throw me with Ross swearing so much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09twr53">This Country on BBC iPlayer</a> recently returned for a third series. We love this comedy show as it’s scarily close to home with the lifestyle of youths living in a rural village. The script is brilliant though, huge kudos to brother and sister Daisy and Charlie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80197526?source=35">Sex Education on Netflix</a> came to an end (for us at least - binge-series has broken that pattern!). Whilst watching teenagers talk about sex is quite awkward as a middle-aged bloke, I do appreciate the content for youngsters to learn from plus the characters and acting is brilliant. Will it continue? Probably but I don’t think it needs to.</p>

<p><em>Week 11 of 2020 brings remote-working fun, triathalon of fitness, cancelled holidays, Ashley Baxter, Disney Plus, mesh networks, Noughts + Crosses &amp; more super-natural boxsets. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coronavirus pandemic hit properly this week, forcing most staff to work from home rather than the office in London. On the bright side, its reducing all that travel to and from the office plus I get more time with the family. On the flip side, it's been quite the challenge adapting to an isolated working environment with no people around me and trying to be as productive as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The big project is going quite well (all things considered). Remote working has introduced some technical issues for the engineers and teams but, after a few days working through connection woes and remote builds on our internal infrastructure, progress got back on track.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As someone who always encourages face-to-face comms over digital, I've had to find innovative new ways to make that work. Regular video calls with colleagues has helped me keep sane and constant chat over Slack maintained my banter levels.&nbsp;Virtual Friday beers was certainly welcomed with some Zoom calls but, truth be told, I've been having a drink at the end of most days - a terrible consequence of not having to drive to or from work on a daily basis. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the new remote working habit, I've had to adjust my health and wellbeing. Lunchtimes have been the ideal opportunity to get exercise so, thanks to a friend's offer, I'm making the most of a free pass to the local hotel swimming pool. 60 lengths in half hour is a good benchmark but I need to confirm the lap length as I'm pretty sure it's not the 20m guess I'm setting on my Apple Watch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've also mixed exercise up with a jog and cycle which has got me thinking about a triathlon challenge for next year. The Coronavirus pandemic is forcing most events to cancel this year so we're waiting for our Jurassic Coast Challenge to be either put on hold or, worse still, completely cancelled. I'll need another challenge to motivate me with fitness.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, our holiday to Bali is on the rocks too. It's 3 weeks away and, as of Sunday afternoon, non-essential travel restrictions have been put in place by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/indonesia?utm_source=926f1abd-f7fa-4669-b737-005e6dafa9ab&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=immediate">Foreign Office</a>. <a href="https://secretescapes.com/">Secret Escapes</a> suggest they'll comply with Foreign Office advice so here's hoping they'll honour the refund. It's a bad year for hospitality but they can't expect customers to suck up the loss of 4-figure package holidays. </p>

<h2>Sides</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Working from home has limited my side project activities (losing all that commute time) but I've spent the same time box at home in the morning focused on editing <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a>. <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/ashley-baxter/">Ashley's episode</a> went live last Monday and <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/marc-littlemore/">Marc's episode</a> was prepared for this Monday. The final episode of the series with <strong>Dan Davies</strong> needs producing then I'll be taking a break from making, but continuing to promote and gather audience feedback. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that podcast on a break, I'll be shifting focus to the <strong>Spring Break</strong> mix for <a href="https://housefinesse.com/">House Finesse</a>. My music collection has got quite healthy over the past few weeks and there's now enough to fill an hour mix. I'm thinking we could create a double or triple mix as a collective each season but it all depends on Matt and Stu's capacity. I know Stu will be game but let's see. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the Coronavirus throwing all things out, my attempt at being a <a href="http://sijobling.com/vote/">local non-standing Green Party candidate</a> has been put on hold until next year's local elections. I was preparing more content for my political minister such as Green Tech Advocacy and better options for transport but at least now I've got more time to work on it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dropbox to iCloud migration is proving quite painful. iCloud Files on Windows is extremely unreliable and slow, after a week of trying to sync, still not 100% accurate and uploads from the Windows 10 device border-line non-existent. Back to the drawing board!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With <a href="https://preview.disneyplus.com/uk">Disney Plus</a> fast approaching and the family keen to sign up, I'm trying to work out how to get it on our main living room TV. Our 4K NowTV (Roku) device should support it but I'm still waiting for <a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1238882276592754693">some advice from them</a>. I'm resisting the desire to buy another device until I know but it's worth it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a week of remote working, I'm also considering a better home network to cope with video calls and the whole family streaming through the day. Our Sky Fibre Max package isn't brilliant but I do feel the default router is holding us back. A mesh network such as this <a href="https://amzn.to/2Uaslpj">LinkSys Velop solution</a> will probably be best, especially following advice from Mr Norton, so I might treat us if the government close down schools. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p082w992">Noughts + Crosses</a> on BBC has been a joy to watch. Such an interesting concept switching the race power around plus Jack Rowan has excelled yet again in his role. I will probably be getting the book series following this as well. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80244781?source=35">I Am Not Okay With This</a> on Netflix ticks all the boxes with a coming-of-age plot, retro 80's vibe and super-natural powers. Wyatt Olef is a star in himself too - definitely one to watch in the future.</p>

<p><em>This week, I'm going to try something a little different by pulling in a weekly digest of tweets which includes a range of life, tech and side projects.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've had an IFTTT recipe running for a few months now which automatically sends me an email highlighting my tweets from the past week. Ideally, I'd create a draft post automatically which I can then edit but I can't find anything quickly and easily. For now, I'm just going to copy-paste them in but will look into it this week.</p>

<p><em>Week 13 of 2020 brings a mixture of emotions through the COVID-19 lockdown including embarrassing praise at work, keeping positive through hard times, Dan Davies wrapping up MLW, more Disney+ challenges, Fatboy Slim, Defected's second virtual festival and EURO '96.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm going to continue the format of digesting previous week's tweets but restoring the sections I started off with to give it a bit more structure. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>As we continue with the Coronavirus lockdown (which I have <a href="http://sijobling.com/life/lockdown/">blogged about recently</a>), working remotely continues to challenge society. Dom's side project struck a nerve with me though, especially finding a good balance of work schedules with family time.</p>

<p>After a two week self-isolation, we finally got out to a supermarket for a decent food shop (and a little retail therapy for my wife). It was certainly a strange experience though with limited fresh food stock on the shelves, very few people around but, equally, plenty distance between people respecting the 2 metre rule. This is definitely a strange time we're going through.</p>

<p>Being stuck at home has certainly scuppered my fitness plans over the past month but, after self-isolation was lifted, I was straight out for a run around the village. Two runs in three days seems like a good start and I'll continue to try 3 days next week.</p>

<p>As the weather picked up this past weekend, we took to the garden for some DIY, the first BBQ of the year and intent to camp overnight with the kids. Unfortunately, the weather forecast a high chance of rain so we decided to play safe.</p>

<p>Side projects have taken a break over the past few weeks since concluding Season 2 of <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a>. I thought I'd keep the product alive though with a sticker giveaway on Friday which got 5 or 6 responses. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also put my head down "in the studio" to produce an hour mix for this season's <a href="https://housefinesse.com">House Finesse</a> show due out for this coming Easter weekend. It was great fun returning to music production although re-training my brain to use <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/live/">Ableton Live 10</a> on Windows rather than Mac did slow down my process somewhat.</p>

<p>I was saddened to hear over the weekend two magazines I was actually featured in have come to an end. I can understand how difficult it is to keep print magazines relevant through a digital era, especially with lack of stability through this pandemic, but it definitely made me realise how valuable their publishing efforts will be missed, an art that has definitely died through self-publication.</p>

<p>Let's end the week on a high with some uplifting music. I've always been a fan of Jools Buckley who popularised orchestras performing dance music live (hat-tip to Pete Tong too for putting his name to it) so, when I saw a feature on BBC News about the <a href="https://www.kaleidoscopeorchestra.co.uk/">Kaleidoscope Orchestra</a> performing "Set You Free" via Zoom, it gave me a warm fuzzy feeling to know (a) people are staying connected with tech across <em>all </em>communities and (b) dance music still has the power to bring energy and happiness through tough times.</p>

<p><em>Week 15 of 2020 brings another multi-team project, Easter isolation DIY, return of House Finesse, Roku Express delights, The Nest, Nick Hornby and Victoria Lee.</em> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m returning to the original format of long-form text, grouped by the same topics. I felt I was cheating a little with the Twitter digest format plus the process to capture them automatically was taking too much time considering the value. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another month, another big multi-team project to focus my energy on. This time, it was to re-apply some of the best practices we want to roll out across our engineering teams. There are certain habits and processes that we think will aid delivery and reporting which we’ve already trialled on another programme of work so this was a chance to try it on a different context. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, I’m not able to divulge too many details but it is definitely another milestone in the new career - and, as I’m in my third month, it’s also the fourth programme of work that requires my attention. Let’s just say I should probably get used to flipping focus this frequently. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, we should’ve been holidaying in Bali as part of our 40th blow out. Obviously, Coronavirus restrictions have put a hold on that so we’re finding other ways to treat ourselves. We’ve ordered a hot-tub for the garden but, due to high demand, it won’t arrive until mid-to-late May. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting a full refund for our holiday has proven extremely difficult too. Despite endless calls and emails to the provider, they are typically dragging their feet to release the funds back to my credit card. Once I’ve got some resolution, I will name and shame but until then (hopefully this week), I’ll hold off. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the Easter weekend and extended bank holidays, we’ve also made the most of quality time with the kids. Sunday night was spent camping in the garden but was short-lived following a toilet trip at 4am. We’ve also been redecorating the summer house after a clear out with a more nautical theme. It’s been lovely getting to spend so much time outdoors with the family and extremely satisfying to get handy on some DIY. This lockdown does have some perks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exercise is hard to fit in with working from home permanently. My hours are generally 8:30-5:30 so by the time I finish work and sit down with the kids for dinner, I’m too tired to get out. I managed to get a couple evening runs in though, even joined the boy on one of his jogs one evening and ran after Princess riding her bike. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Good Friday, we put out a much-needed dose of House Finesse with an <a href="https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/house-finesse-85-spring-break-2020/">extended 2-hour format</a> now that we’re reducing the frequency to quarterly. It was great fun producing the mix and quite straight forward collaborating with Stu on it. My uncompressed WAV was shared through iCloud and his final MP3 was then uploaded to Pinecast. Artwork was created with Canva and, following some RSS tinkering Friday morning, people were downloading it all weekend with over 150 in the first 24 hours. Most shows get about 1,500 downloads so we’re off to a good start. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also blogged on life <a href="http://sijobling.com/life/day-17/">17 days into the lockdown</a>. I’m trying to write a lot more at the moment, using the opportunity to flex my writing muscles and capture key memories. It might be hard at times, especially with the topics, but it will be worth it in the future as so many people keep referencing these “unprecedented times”. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roku Express has continued to impress with its wealth of supported content providers. I bought it as the cheapest option to support DisneyPlus but I was delighted to notice AppleTV was also available along with Prime and NowTV. The iOS app also improves the UX for easier navigation so compared to an Apple TV box, it’s about 20% the cost but provides most the features required. Even this Apple Fanboy is impressed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also managed to revive an old 2TB Western Digital network drive which I thought had seen its days. It’s now plugged into the Linksys mesh network so it’s discoverable on all internal devices, with more than a decade’s worth of content to browse. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The Nest on BBC is continuing to keep us gripped on with the surrogate mother and murder mystery. Plenty twists and turns to keep you hooked. </li><li>I finished reading Slam by Nick Hornby last week. Slightly indulgent and definitely not as literally challenging as I should be reading, but I’ve always been a fan of Hornby’s stories so it was a delight to complete that one. </li><li>I’ve now started reading The Fever King by Victoria Lee - a dystopian fiction which appears to combine politics, magic and futuristic happenings. First few chapters are difficult to get in to but I’m persisting. </li></ul>

<p><em>Week 16 of 2020 brings Slack etiqette suggestions, Easter DIY, fitness parenting, credit card disputes, video mixes in Filmora9, wireless chargers, Glitterbox virtual festival, Killing Eve, My Left Nut and Friday Night Dinner.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the Easter weekend, I decided to extend my break with a few extra days at home to focus on some DIY and spend some quality time with the family. More on that later but it meant only two days of work for the week. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remote working continued to test me, especially trying to chase people for updates and information which I’d typically get off my arse and speak to people face-to-face. I have found some people are harder to contact than others, but I do appreciate they want to focus or have other commitments. I did tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1250727387383377920">using suitable statuses</a> in comms apps like Slack, choosing “<em>focus time</em>” or “<em>break time</em>” to manage expectations. It’s something I try to get in a better habit of, even adding working hours to a custom stauts, but it does take some extra effort and not everyone notices or honours them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Extra time with the family allowed us to get handy and creative in real life:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Mrs J <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_AQxEEJi5S/">recreated two iconic portraits</a> with the kids; Girl with a Pearl Earring and Salvidor Dali </li><li>Our shed (summer house) got a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-2dHikJ2XA/">lick of paint</a> over a few days whilst the sun was shining</li><li>Plenty odd-jobs around the house and garden that seem to often get neglected due to other distractions</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've also started doing more exercise with the kids where possible. Joe Wicks (aka The Body Coach) started running daily PE lessons on YouTube Live so we started doing them in the garden (for some extra space) and I've been running 2km with the boy followed by chasing my daughter on her bike for a few kilometres to get some fitness in with them both. I've resurrected <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/2525944">my Strava account</a> for the runs too - "friend me" if you're on there and fancy some friendly competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, we've made <em>some</em> progress on the refund for our cancelled holiday (which I'll reserve names until we are fully resolved). Following endless calls to the customer service number, to which we often got "just wait" replies and zero escalation, I've now taken it to our credit card company as a dispute. They reassured me it should yield better results but managed expectations it could take 6-8 weeks, especially through these difficult times. Lesson learned? Always make large transactions on credit cards for this exact reason; they have teams of people prepared to chase disputes when many of us simply don't have the suitable time or capacity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm taking a break from any serious side projects at the moment, after wrapping up <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">series 2 of Make Life Work</a> and getting <a href="https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/house-finesse-85-spring-break-2020/">House Finesse Spring Break</a> out. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I did create a video of the House Finesse mix we could potentially share on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhRURxaNkKS4YytBGqlKEA?view_as=subscriber">our YouTube channel</a>. I used a Windows app called <a href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editor/">Filmora9 </a>which is quite user-friendly and versatile. You can trial the app which renders with a huge watermark across the export but I'm mindful Youtube might remove the mix due to copyright infringement. To test the waters, I've uploaded it as an unlisted item and will leave it for a week or two, then I'll know if it's worth producing a version without a watermark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mentioned above, this week I've been getting in to more video editing with Filmora9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also invested in a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07ZHTH9RC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=simonjoblin0d-21&amp;linkId=bfd56434c0783d4526f5b72eb5bd01a3">combo wireless charger for all my Apple devices</a>. One reason was to try wireless charging of my iPhone 11 - a feature I've not even tested yet but could be handy in my office setup. That said, combining all the cables for Watch, Airpods and iPhone on my bedside was the main instigator. Charging my iPhone is seamless and the extra lightning adapator is convenient for Airpods but I've found the Watch charger is unreliable for me. Power seems to be transferring with the contact point getting warm but it appears to be draining it instead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elsewhere, I'm now exploring some treats for my birthday including a new Mac and, if budget allows, some new DJ decks. I need something better for producing my mixes and suitable specs to support audio/video production so considering a MacBook Pro but currently holding off with pending announcements due of new kit coming soon. I'm also eyeing up some Pioneer DDJ-400's along with some reasonable speakers in the studio. Best consider some extra egg-cartons to sound-proof the room too...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defected hosted another "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ZgjzkyK7A">virtual festival</a>" on Friday, this time with a very heavy Glitterbox roster including many of favourite DJs such as Purple Disco Machine, Bob Sinclar, Mousse T and (new to me) Natasha Diggs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also decided to hook up an old record player with the Marshall speaker to listen to some vinyl over the weekend. It reminded me how much I miss the feel of "real" media (especially after seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo2ilgAzNQs">Natasha Diggs in her NYC set</a>) and the sound is definitely superior to digital equivalents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000hrg4/killing-eve-series-3-2-management-sucks">Killing Eve on BBC</a> returned to much fanfair last week and it didn't disappoint. Jody's performance is as strong as previous series and I can't wait to see where it all goes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p083shlt">My Left Nut on BBC</a> is a tough one to watch - another "coming-of-age" story, this time based around a young Irish lad who discovers a lump in his nether regions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/friday-night-dinner/">Friday Night Dinner on All4</a> returned recently for a 6th series and continues to tickle the chuckle bones. Some ridiculously far-fetched moments but, oddly, relatable.</p>

<p><em>Week 17 of 2020 brings remote working normalisation, fitness apps, Lockdown chat groups, another Make Life Work series, hair colouring, Windows 98, Little Warden, The Big Night In, Gorgon City, Colin Furze and Gangs of London.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I'm continuing to try a suitable balance and format for these, I'm going to reference my weekly Twitter Digest for some points to flag in the typical sections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Week 7 of remote working. This is starting to feel like the norm, despite nearly 20 years of working in an office. Things will be different once we're through it all.</p><cite>(<a href="http://twitter.com/Si/status/1252174367255146496">Twitter</a>)</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I realised this week I've spent more time at home than in the office with the new job. Many of our challenges around communication and collaboration have been addressed but I'm still trying to find the right balance between meetings and productive time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, I managed to get a 4 day streak of exercise in (thanks to my TickTick habit tracker). Three of them were runs around the village and one "PE lesson" with Joe &amp; the boy. I'm not measuring the outcomes (naughty me) but I definitely feel a sense of satisfaction from it all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One run even inspired a quick Twitter poll on popular fitness tracking apps with Apple being the favourite followed by Strava.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6423,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1253360695745417216"><img src="http://sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6423"/></a><figcaption>Apple most popular fitness tracker, possibly biased considering my Twitter audience</figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the family continue to adjust to Lockdown Lifestyle with most of us spread around the house doing our respective work, the Boy used his initiative to get our attention...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our house has reached a new level - the boy has asked for a cup of tea from his bedroom USING WHATSAPP</p><cite>(<a href="http://twitter.com/Si/status/1253251397853892608">Twitter Source</a>)</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, with Mrs J back in her school supporting the keyworkers' kids, she missed the opportunity to get herself tested for COVID-19 when registration passed so quickly and during core hours. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In light of all the home isolation though, I realised times have certainly changed quite rapidly when it comes to weekend socialising for myself and the kids...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I can't believe my Friday night is arranging Zoom calls over the weekend for friends and family. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SocialDistancing?src=hashtag_click">#SocialDistancing</a></p><cite>(<a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1253769017543790594">Twitter</a>)</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've been toying with the idea of a <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> “<em>Home Edition</em>” (hat-tip to Dom for the name) but need to work out all the logistics of it. Considering it's all about finding a suitable balance between professional, personal and side projects, I need to practice what I preach with my own situation and be mindful of others too. At least there's demand for it though...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6424,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1252302372308738048"><img src="http://sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6424"/></a><figcaption>9 out of 9 people said they would like a new series about wellbeing and challenging times.</figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm not the only one getting on the side project hustle now though; Mrs J and Princess made their very first Youtube video, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EZb5d3UIPc&amp;t=11s">Lockdown Guide to Hair Colouring</a>".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amongst all this, I've been doing some (Youtube) research on some manual labour projects such as making a pizza oven in the garden and sorting out a loft conversion. In the mean time, we've just sorted out the summer house to make it more comfortable for possible outdoor creative time which could give me space to record Make Life Work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few things caught my attention from around the tech circuit this week:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.avodocs.com/">Avodocs </a>offers free legal documents for startups so you can focus energy on making your product - 3 free docs a month should get you going</li><li>Anyone else miss simpler times of Windows 98? I'd love to reminisce over some websites using this <a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/">Win98.css style guide</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/AnnieAtkins">@AnnieAtkins</a> created some lovely "lockdown posters" with some clear messages </li></ul>

<h2>Entertainment </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like many across the UK on Thursday evening, we watched the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bignightin">Big Night In</a> on BBC to see what they had to offer with some creative ways recording and broadcasting the material. We made our obligatory donations and grabbed a few copies of the <a href="https://t.co/m6SN2R5uwH?amp=1">Foo Fighters' "Times Like These" cover</a> (despite only half the proceeds going to the cause).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I then spent Friday evening enjoying another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6JbFqg5ono&amp;feature=youtu.be">Defected Virtual Festival</a> from the comfort of my own lounge along with thousands of others. Gorgon City's set was on point and a great way to wrap up a (boozy) night in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amongst all this, I've also discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/colinfurze">Colin Furze's YouTube channel </a>with his bonkers inventions. I don't think I'm the only one in awe of his dad pad(s) and crazy antics - plus it's giving me some great ideas for home renovations and other YouTube content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the latest boxset to grab our attention is <a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/gangs-of-london">Gangs of London</a> on Sky Atlantic. The opening scene and episode are brilliant, instantly hooks you in, and some of the fight scenes are phenomenally filmed. We're only one and a half episodes in but definitely one to watch.</p>

<p><em>Week 18 of 2020 brings team changes, domestic games room, obligatory May fitness challenges, return of Make Life Work, kitchen speakers, Nick Spalding and some Japanese philosophy.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the week before my probation review - how is it already 3 months since I started this job? It was a real mix of emotions though as a colleague who started just before me decided the role wasn’t for him so left Friday and we also welcomed a new member to the Delivery team on Thursday. The function is relatively new but with some fantastic opportunities to address technical and logistical challenges; the team have a great mix of skills and energy to make things work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pool table came out this weekend – a freecycled acquisition from a few years back when a neighbour was giving it away. We’ve spent the majority of our time knocking balls around, teaching the kids the rules, whilst I’ve revisited my youth when I spent far too many 50p’s in the nearby pub honing my craft. It’s amazing how quickly it comes back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also got my decks out the loft to start sorting out one of the rooms as an entertainment hub to accompany the pool table. I’m now eyeing up a pair of Stanmore’s as an early birthday treat to get the true sound my old vinyl deserves. As long as it gets Mrs J’s aesthetic approval, we’re all good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fitness has taken a bit of a hit this week though; after an early 6km run around the village (a personal best according to Strava), I realised a terrible bloody blister had formed on my big right toe causing anguish on every step. To top things off, I’ve also caused some serious damage to my left foot after stumping it in the dark loft. Time to recover, quite an annoying coincidence as I signed up for a 60 day trial of Strava Summit. However, I have given myself a goal:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Signed up for the #MayAnyway Challenge to run 50km through May. Nice goal to motivate some fitness during these times.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/tcVQV1vdAZ" target="_blank">https://t.co/tcVQV1vdAZ</a></p><cite><a href="http://twitter.com/Si/status/1255217743223234560">via Twitter</a></cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the lockdown continues, the family have continued to find creative ways to keep entertained. The boy helped grandad create a little area for growing vegetables, the girl got a desk setup in the summerhouse for some crafty time, the wife has been moving furniture around for a change and I’ve been organising the loft prior to a proper refurb. Being stuck at home does give you some ideal time to give it some much-needed TLC with no excuses. Amazon Prime is certainly getting it’s moneys-worth through these strange times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sides </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>So, considering it was a resounding "yes" (despite relatively low numbers), I'm now working out the logistics to make it happen and keep it as simple as possible.</p><cite><a href="http://twitter.com/Si/status/1254725124214984704">via Twitter</a></cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve now organised the first recording for Make Life Work “<em>Home Edition</em>”, inviting fellow podcaster <a href="https://twitter.com/lurkmoophy">Luke Murphy</a> along for a chat about how he’s coping through the lockdown. There are a few other gentlemen keen to get involved including previous guests but I’d also like to get some diversity on the line-up before it just turns out to be another podcast of middle-aged white blokes chatting about how hard things are. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of which...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Lovely to wrap up the week with a cheeky @OnTheSideNet virtual beer session this evening. Just a shame it was cut short for Princess' first homemade dinner instead of the @Beer52HQ taste test.</p><cite><a href="http://twitter.com/Si/status/1256281985380687875">via Twitter</a></cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like many geek dads, I’m trying to find a decent level of smart tech around the house with our “Ladies in the Tube”, Alexa, Google and Siri supporting the speaker systems. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kitchen now has a (small) pair of Bluetooth speakers for a good boogie whilst cooking and cleaning and, as mentioned above, we’re now sourcing some high quality speakers to accompany the record player.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was great to discover another company doing good through the Coronavirus, offering an opportunity for people to buy beer for the carers:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Dear NHS workers, <a href="https://www.brewgooder.com/oneonus">have one on us</a>! I’ve bought one of you heroes a round so go ahead and claim it. &#x1f44f;</p><cite>via <a href="HTTP://TWITTER.COM/SI/STATUS/1254496467802361858">Twitter</a></cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow side-project advocate Kevin took to a <a href="https://www.kevincunningham.co.uk/posts/gatsby-digital-garden-mob-programming/">live mob-coding</a> exercise Monday evening extending Gatsby with a "digital playground" (think wiki) which was fascinating to watch. Kevin has a natural energy which comes across wonderful and I really liked how there was a group of people coordinating the event which allowed Kevin to concentrate on the code whilst others monitored Q&amp;A from viewers.</p>

<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've just finished reading Fat Chance by Nick Spalding - an easy-read about a similarly-aged couple battling in a weight-loss competition for a local radio. Nothing challenging or enlightening but easy escapism during my daily half-hour read.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve now started reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B074TWG8V7/ref=x_gr_w_bb_sin_nodl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=x_gr_w_bb_sin_uk-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738">The Courage To Be Disliked: How to free yourself, change your life and achieve real happiness</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14541046.Ichiro_Kishimi">Ichiro Kishimi</a> – the first non-fiction read of the year with an appetite for some philosophy and self-help.</p>

<p><em>Week 19 of 2020 brings weekly outlining, failed DIY, Luke Murphy in lockdown, a new hearables store, Elton John on vinyl, Wired mag, Killing Eve, Workin' Moms and Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A four-day week before the VE Day / May Bank Holiday hybrid allowed many of us to cram 5 days work into 4. The goods news was I passed my probation on Monday so that put my mind at ease that all my efforts so far are pleasing management and the company. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Considering workload and prioritisation, this might be a good week to describe my typical process to organise the week’s agenda. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Monday morning, I copy a OneNote template with the typical outline for a week, each weekday as a heading. This includes regular meetings with times and daily/weekly actions that are standard issue (coincidentally including “provide weekly update”). </li><li>I then go through the previous week’s outline pulling out any unfinished actions, compiled in a “This Week” list at the top of my OneNote. </li><li>I then prioritise this list along with any extra actions for the coming week. </li><li>As I start each day, I add in extra meetings and actions, sometimes rolling over from previous days. </li><li>As daily meetings and actions occur, I tend to add extra lists beneath each item, include any further actions, even link out to extra notes when they get quite long (or require extra structure).</li><li>I then use these documents for my weekly report, edit out sensitive information, shared with my line manager and team for visibility and audit trails. </li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve found this system works quite well for me as I can also embed links, images (such as screenshots) and other Office docs directly in the weekly notes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is an evolution of a previous technique that used <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear on macOS and iOS</a> instead but, for privacy reasons and financial legislation, I’ve had to adapt it to a Windows &amp; Office environment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lockdown continues in Jobling Manor and, as we entered the extended weekend, we planned out a variety of DIY projects (in our new Trello board) including kitchen tiling/grouting, downstairs shower replacement and iMac SSD upgrade. Unfortunately, none of them got done due to unexpected missing parts. Lockdown certainly hampers any unplanned DIY with most shops either being closed or only offering collection planned around bank holiday closures. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>One success was replacing The Boy’s front bicycle wheel which allowed us to go for a cycle around the nearby countryside. It was only as we got to 10km that the gear changes stopped working on both bikes. A slow, difficult ride home in the heat concluded in some extra handiwork fixing those. Riding over the A14 on a Saturday afternoon seemed eerily quiet though (see the featured image).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Boris has just presented the next phase of lockdown. Typically ambiguous and open to interpretation, it looks like manual workers will be eased back into their jobs in safe environments. Hospitality may be phased back in July which is quite a gamble for my 40th birthday efforts so I’ll be considering alternative plans to celebrate. Beer + Zoom + (new) hot-tub = plenty potential for hilarity and debauchery. </p>

<h2>Sides</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first episode of <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> “<em>Home Edition</em>” came out this week. Recorded Monday and released Thursday, <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/luke-murphy/">my chat with Luke</a> felt quite natural and the shorter format definitely works better for faster turnaround. We used <a href="https://zencastr.com/">Zencastr </a>for the recording but Luke suggested Zoom for future episodes. Having video available will certainly make the conversation feel more natural and individual audio tracks will help production. Plus EVERYONE is on Zoom right now so easy for access. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the weekend, I also remembered a random domain purchase from last year. On a whim, I noticed <a href="https://hearables.store">hearables.store</a> was available so grabbed it. I thought I’d give Shopify a go which certainly made the job easy, especially with auto-fulfilment through integrated providers. It needs a lot of love but it was quite motivating to get my first online store operational in 24 hours. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tech</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, it’s been all about classic tech. I plugged my old Gemini XL-500 record player into the Marshall Stanmore speaker with a phono cable but it reminded me the output needs a pre-amp. After that, I bought a transformer to power up a briefcase record player. Result! Now we can play all our old vinyl at a decent volume in the games room. Cue Elton John’s Greatest Hits from the 80s. The sound is definitely superior to digital - you can almost feel the beats and guitar strums as they pour out the Marshall. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back to current times, I also eyed up a brand new <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro-13/">13" MacBook Pro</a> as an early birthday treat. I hovered over the purchase button for all of ten minutes before indulging. But, after an unexpected electricity bill of similar value, the order was cancelled. Something for next month hopefully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve taken a break from my Kindle this week, instead spending my daily half hour read catching up on some unread Wired magazines. I do love the tangible feel of printed media, especially the delightful weight of Conde Nast’s publications, but I am in a bit of dilemma as a tech and green advocate - especially as I’m reading about new tech, eco startups and the concerns of socio-political issues. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On TV, we’ve been continuing to enjoy Killing Eve on BBC iPlayer and the new series of Workin’ Moms on Netflix. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saturday night, we also had a “grown up” movie night with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4KNBwPAYz0">The Gentlemen on YouTube</a>. Guy Ritchie does make an enjoyable gangster flick and Hugh Grant played his alternative character quite well but it didn’t quite have the typical depth or twists compared to the likes of Lock Stock or Snatch. </p>

<p><em>Week 20 of 2020 (all the twenties!) brings iMac repairs, pesky mice, cycling, Stephen Turvey-Wright, Glitterbox Accapellas, video calls, energy disrupters, Shapeshifters, Brassic 2 and Dead To Me.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, I’m going to try something a bit more short-hand than long wordy versions - let’s see how it goes…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Lockdown continues despite a questionable curve in numbers and confusing messages from our ever-reassuring government. 10 weeks working from home now and no sign of returning yet. <em>#work</em> <em>#covid19</em></li><li>Gran reminded me of my “political career” - I really should revive that push. I did miss two online Green Party meetings though so not a great start. <em>#life</em> <em>#work</em> <em>#greenparty</em></li><li>Mini DIY jobs around the house including downstairs shower replacement, pool cue holder in the games room and failed attempt to replace hard-drive in my old 2011 iMac. <em>#tech</em> <em>#life</em> <em>#home</em></li><li>We did find some little visitors &#x1f401;  in the house last week so pest control came out dropping traps around the place. It’s forced the dog to stay next door as she can’t be trusted with the poison. <em>#life</em> <em>#home</em></li><li>Bought a set of dynamic mics for some fun karaoke time with the family. Works great with my old mixer but the kids need convincing - plus adults need more alcohol. <em>#life</em> <em>#music</em></li><li>Hit some PB’s on a run this week; longest distance, fastest mile and half mile and others. Frustratingly duplicated the recording though as I started Strava on Watch first then accepted Apple’s prompt on detecting movement. <em>#health</em></li><li>Lots of cycling with the kids this week, one with each to find their range and pace then another together to encourage sibling bonding. <em>#life</em> <em>#health</em></li><li>Caught up with old ASOS chum <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/stephen-turvey-wright/">Stephen Turvey-Wright</a> for this week’s <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a>. Wonderful to have a chat with someone familiar and he seemed to really enjoy it. Don’t use Zoom though as the quality is not great and it’s only single track. <em>#sides</em> <em>#makelifework</em></li><li>Started dabbling in a few iPad apps to make some music using <a href="https://www.beatport.com/release/glitterbox-accapellas-volume-1/2952492">Glitterbox Accapellas</a> and Purple Disco Machine samples. GarageBand is the obvious choice but the UX is far from obvious to my mind. I do wish Ableton ported Live over to the mobile stack! <em>#sides</em> <em>#music</em></li><li>Discovered “<em>Hide self view</em>” in Zoom, a great little feature to make sure you concentrate on your peers rather than your background - something I’ve noticed myself doing time-to-time, especially as I read about “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90502253/why-you-feel-exhausted-from-endless-zoom-calls">Zoom fatigue</a>” <em>#mrvain</em> <em>#tech</em></li><li>Tried to find a Donut equivalent for Teams as a tool for Microsoft houses (schools) to randomly pair people together through lockdown - no joy but maybe there’s a chance in the market <em>#tech</em> <em>#sides</em></li><li>After ongoing troubles with our electricity provider, I started looking around for alternatives. <a href="https://twitter.com/si/status/1260652277569732609?s=21">A Twitter poll</a> suggested Bulb is the most popular disruptor so will shift to them soon. <em>#life</em> <em>#tech</em></li><li>Glitterbox’s Virtual Festival returned this week bringing many of my favourite DJ’s and artists including Shapeshifters &amp; Michael Gray. Friday evenings are my new favourite time of the week! <em>#entertainment</em> <em>#music</em></li><li>Brassic 2 on Sky Atlantic and Dead To Me on Netflix have been this week’s TV highlights; both fantastic dark comedies, just with completely different tones and angles.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I quite like how much easier that was - more condensed, succinct and some flexibility on how to take it forward. Plus it took about half hour rather than the usual hour. I’d love feedback from anyone who reads it and can compare.</p>

<p><em>Week 21 of 2020 brings running Dom, mental health awareness, beardy chats with Dan &amp; Sush, large portion of sides, Blue Nation, Friday beers, Kukd and bank holi-DIY.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s try the bullet points format again, this time in chronological order, tagging with suitable hashtags. This mode might be easier to build up over a week too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Monday, I was inspired to see Dom’s announcement to do 26 half marathons every Friday morning, building up to The Dopey in Florida, all for Martins House Hospice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kZEcXPo799g">Watch the launch video</a> with his daughter for some delightful insights  <em>#sides</em> <em>#charity</em></li><li>Tuesday, I got some family news at lunch that completely threw my mental health out for the rest of the day. I struggled to concentrate and focus but decided to battle on regardless, inform the boss at the end of the day and even make it public. Some might see it as showing vulnerability but, with it being mental health awareness month, it felt right to get it out there. The responses from Twitter were wonderful too and proved it’s worth voicing your challenges. <em>#life</em> <em>#mentalhealth</em> <em>#work</em></li><li>Wednesday, I caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/danjdavies">Dan Davies</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/maxray">Sush Kelly</a> for an impromptu chat that we planned to record for <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a>. The three way conversation actually worked quite well but, unfortunately, we forgot to record Skype and one local device so that ended that idea. <em>#sides</em> <em>#tech</em></li><li>Thursday, I noticed a few new registrations in our <a href="https://ontheside.network">On The Side Slack community</a>. It reminded me Tom May asked a few weeks back about it so, after a quick search, I noticed we were <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/8-online-meetups-that-are-helping-the-creative-community">featured on Creative Bloq</a>. It’s wonderful to see a steady stream of new faces joining, especially from around the globe. <em>#sides</em> <em>#ontheside</em></li><li>At lunch, I caught up with Dom after the launch of his fundraising campaign to find out how he’s doing and record something for Make Life Work. I’d already set expectations on Twitter there wouldn’t be an episode this week so it was a great backup plan. We used <a href="https://squadcast.fm/?ref=si">Squadcast </a>this time which worked really well but I did notice I had to pay extra for recording time. <em>#sides</em> <em>#makelifework</em> <em>#charity</em></li><li>In the evening, we noticed one of our favourite bands <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlueNationMusic/posts/285490315792749/">Blue Nation were doing a live stream on Facebook</a> to raise money for Birmingham hospitals. I’m loving all the good deeds coming out of our circle of friends at the moment. Gives me some hope in society amongst the crazy government guidance and idiotic behaviours of a select few. <em>#entertainment</em> <em>#music</em> <em>#charity</em></li><li>Friday morning, we watched Dom run his first half marathon <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHodge/status/1263697854427611136?s=20">live on Twitch</a>. The man pushed hard and made it look relatively easy but we all know it was no mean feat. A wonderful start to the day - even Princess was absorbed in his effort for the final hour. I then <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/run-dom-run/">published our conversation</a> on the podcast. <em>#life</em> <em>#charity</em></li><li>At the end of the day, we had a team social with a few beers - all part of the “fun budget” we have to spend every month. Whilst it was great to wind down and not talk shop, jumping on another Zoom call doesn’t lend that well to social norms. Awkward silences and virtual backgrounds certainly don’t help. <em>#work</em> <em>#tech</em></li><li>We did discover another online takeaway provider called <a href="https://kukd.com">Kukd </a>this weekend which, unlike Deliveroo and Just Eat, actually deliver Indian and pizzas to our locality. The food was actually quite good and punctual as well so definitely recommended. <em>#tech</em> <em>#life</em></li><li>Over the bank holiday weekend, I managed to tackle more DIY around the house including relaying kitchen floor tiles, regrouting some areas and sealing around the worktops. Thankfully, our local recycling centre had opened its doors too so I managed to clear the garden waste out with a few trips. <em>#life</em></li><li>Exercise didn’t happen much this week - no real excuses but I only managed one morning run. Need to get back on it after all the bank holiday indulgence. <em>#life</em> <em>#health</em></li></ul>

<p><em>Week 22 of 2020 brings Green Party memberships, Alex Brooke, Facebook parties, waving on video calls, on-demand video tracking, running PB's and plenty DIY.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Following the COVID-19 pandemic halting procedures along with some questionable leadership from the UK government, I was motivated to renew my Green Party membership and revive <a href="http://sijobling.com/vote/">my local candidacy campaign</a>. Early stages but I’m determined to channel my energy in a more pragmatic way. <em>#life</em> <em>#politics</em></li><li>Tuesday, I caught up with product designer <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/alex-brooke/">Alex Brooke for the Make Life Work podcast</a>. It was great to get someone else’s take on working in-house at scale and hear how Alex is coping through the lockdown. <em>#sides</em> <em>#makelifework</em></li><li>Thursday, I started to consider the logistics of hosting a virtual birthday party with my 40th fast approaching and little desire to mingle in person with friends and family. Whilst Facebook seems like the obvious choice for the masses to access, Zoom could also work and I like the idea of Houseparty for games. <em>#tech</em> <em>#life</em></li><li>My conversation with Alex also raised an interesting topic about <a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1265987735027924998?s=20">waving goodbye as video call etiquette</a>. It seems as if many others do, some even go as far to say “<a href="https://twitter.com/simonhamp/status/1266074441160839169">love you</a>”. <em>#tech</em> <em>#zoom</em></li><li>I started to consider what tools are available for tracking TV viewing habits. All the on-demand services have so much data on us but it doesn’t seem to be readily available. I signed up to <a href="https://trakt.tv/users/sijobling">Trakt</a> to test that with Netflix but it requires a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/traktflix/ehlckfimahifadnbecobagimllmbdmde">Chrome extension</a> which is not ideal. <em>#tech</em> <em>#entertainment</em></li><li>I’m not particularly pleased with the audio quality on my end of <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> so I ordered a new <a href="https://amzn.to/3eHqmkW">desktop boom-style mic stand</a> for one of the dynamic mics I recently ordered for karaoke. Plan is to test it on next week’s episode with Mike Street but I might not have time to get it prepared. <em>#tech</em> <em>#sides</em></li><li>Friday, I managed to <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3530245870">run my personal best of 8.5km</a> (aiming for 8km) as I tried to get closer to the Strava 10km May challenge. Tuesday, I <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3515414965">managed 7.5km</a> (aiming for 7km) so I’m quite proud of my iterative mini-goals to reach the magic 10km. It just means I roll over the challenge to next month. <em>#health</em> <em>#running</em></li><li>Saturday, the bathroom tiles were tackled as we realised they needed replacing. On further inspections, we also discovered an extra foot of space against a fake wall leading to the ventilation. Whoever designed our bathroom before us must’ve had method to the madness but it’s beyond us. <em>#life</em> <em>#diy</em></li><li>Saturday evening, we did our first online Zoom quiz as a family as we noticed a Gavin &amp; Stacey event on Facebook in the morning. It was good fun to participate in but our G&amp;S knowledge was extremely poor compared to the 500 other participants. Give us a Friends, Simpsons or Bottom quiz any day! <em>#entertainment</em> <em>#tech</em></li><li>Sunday, it was outdoor DIY time. The kids “jungle gym” got some optimisations as I removed the excess bridge and tower and repositioned one of the climbing walls. One of the kids old bikes got repaired for giving away then the BBQ got some much needed attention. <em>#life</em> <em>#diy</em></li></ul>

<p><em>Week 23 of 2020 brings a hot-tub, bathroom tiles, Mike Street, Cloudflare, neglected sides, another new PB, Logging Off, commercial tech pivoting through lockdown, Rob Beckett and 90s indulgence.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's go for a bullet-point braindump of things that happened this week. I'll try to cover more entertainment which was neglected over recent weeks too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>This week, we had a new hot tub delivered after waiting nearly two months from ordering (high demand apparently). Following holiday cancellations to celebrate 40th birthdays, it felt like a suitable indulgence which simulates the feeling of being away. Shame the weather turned to typical British rain as it arrived though <em>#life</em> </li><li>Still at home, we started re-tiling the bathroom which has been put off for many years. The featured image is the decor we've gone for and we've made impressive progress, especially cutting some of the funky angles along the wonky walls. Still plenty to do (grouting will be fun) but it's another bit of lockdown DIY that's checked off the list. <em>#life</em> <em>#diy</em></li><li>Thursday, I released the finale of the <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a> "Home Edition" series with <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/mike-street/">Mike Street</a>. It was wonderful to chat with Mike about side projects, leadership and inspiration during fitness - three things we've got in common. His reasons for holding off <a href="https://www.behindthesource.co.uk/">Behind The Source</a> content during the George Floyd racism protests inspired me too. I spent very little time on Twitter, if only to formally syndicate content for the podcast. It feels strange but I'd rather just keep quiet than try to bring attention to an important matter I'd struggle to give justice towards. <em>#sides</em> <em>#makelifework</em></li><li>On side projects, I'd like to spend a bit more time on other projects that need attention over the next few months:<ul><li><a href="http://ontheside.network">On The Side</a> has been a great place to chat about general wellbeing over recent months but seems to have lost it's original focus. I've now installed Donut to improve relationships and try to encourage peer support on individual projects.</li><li><a href="http://housefinesse.com">House Finesse</a> needed the SSL certificate renewing so I shifted DNS to Cloudflare rather than pay for Namecheap's product. </li><li>I also need to understand how drop-shipping works on <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a> and <a href="http://oberlo.com">Oberlo</a> for my <a href="http://hearables.store">Hearables.store</a> and my wife's <a href="http://teachmugs.com">Teach Mugs</a> idea. <em>#sides</em> <em>#tech</em> </li></ul></li><li>On Friday, I managed to squeeze in a new personal best run of 9.2km - just short of the 10km goal. This run took me along the canal to nearby village Yelvetoft then back along the bridlepath. If I wasn't so mindful of time on my lunch-hour, I could probably have hit the goal. At least the cooler/damper weather helped compared to recent scorchers. <em>#fitness</em></li><li>I finished reading "trashy novel" Logging Off this week - a familiar story about a 30-something British chap avoiding tech for health reasons after becoming so dependent on it. I completely relate to this, hence the drive to read offline more (the irony wasn't lost on me for blogging about it and recording progress on Goodreads). <em>#entertainment</em> <em>#reading</em></li><li>The latest Wired magazine conveniently arrived as I finished Logging Off so I decided to focus on that during my daily 20 minutes reading time. Some interesting articles in there, specifically about <a href="https://gower.st/">Gower Street Analytics</a> using big data to forecast ideal dates for movie launches, even pivoting with lockdown causing cinema closures, and a sponsored feature by Ericsson about how 5G could improve global traffic problems - but I do feel there are bigger challenges at foot. Lockdown has certainly been a perfect opportunity to realise how dependent we are on transport for commuting when we clearly don't always have to.</li><li>Other entertainment we've enjoyed this week include <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80993591">White Lines on Netflix</a> (if only for indulging in 90s Ibiza times), <a href="https://lockdownparent.podbean.com/">Lockdown Parenting</a> (thanks to <a href="http://sijobling.com/podcast/sam-hardacre/">Sam</a> for recommending it - always love a bit Rob Beckett and Josh Widdicombe) and discovering <a href="https://planetradio.co.uk/absolute-radio-90s/">Absolute 90's</a> whilst tiling the bathroom - endless tune-after-tune from our era. <em>#entertainment</em> <em>#tv</em> <em>#podcasts</em> <em>#radio</em></li></ul>

<p><em>Week 24 of 2020 brings Slack buddies, 10K run, useless link-sharing, F1 locales, drop-shipping, 4K TV, runny grout and the original Simon Evans.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Monday, we launched <strong>#drink-buddies </strong>using <a href="https://www.donut.com/">Donut</a> in our <a href="https://ontheside.network/">On The Side Slack community</a> - a way to connect members on a weekly basis to attempt improve engagement. We've had a wonderful growth recently thanks to the Creative Bloq feature but I'm keen to get people supporting each other with more regular comms. Early stages look promising: many members arranged video calls for a chat, DM's became the dominant message type with 300% increase in message count across the board and I've enjoyed getting to know one of our new members quite well. <em>#sides</em> <em>#community</em></li><li>Monday evening, I managed to smash my running goal of 10km after missing it in May. It was such a sense of achievement to make the distance plus my pace was better than I expected. My feet have taken a beating in my footwear though so I need to take a break before setting the next goal. <em>#life</em> <em>#health</em> </li><li>Thursday, I was educating my wife on link-sharing with social media; something I realised might be straight-forward to techies but not to the average person. She was trying to share job postings on Facebook and Twitter but the native "share" feature seemed to lose deep-links on a SPA. Why is the Web getting so messy? <em>#life</em> <em>#tech</em></li><li>This weekend, I was impressed to see <a href="http://twitter.com/ay8s">Andy</a> keep up with endless PR's providing <a href="https://github.com/sportstimes/f1/tree/master/locales">extra translations</a> for <a href="https://f1calendar.com/">F1 Calendar</a>. It was all thanks to a well-placed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/h7qe0y/help_us_translate_f1calendarcom/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">Reddit post</a> which spurred 5 extra languages on top of the original request from the previous week. An inspiration for anyone who's struggling to keep motivated through lockdown. <em>#sides</em> <em>#f1</em></li><li>Back on my own sides, I've now worked out how to configure drop-shipping on Hearables.store - it's not as automatic as I originally suspected but the Chrome extension certainly speeds up the process. I've got a current order in progress to understand typical delivery times then I'll work on some content. <em>#sides</em> <em>#dropshipping</em></li><li>My latest birthday lockdown indulgence arrived on Sunday; a new 50" Samsung 4K TV. Our trusty old Samsung 42" plasma has served us well for the past 11 years (and still works fine) but I was keen to upgrade on the picture quality and simplify all the on-demand services with a number of additional boxes getting messy. Unfortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1272129997927518209?s=20">Mrs J wasn't convinced</a> but she's coming round. <em>#life</em> <em>#tech</em></li><li>The bathroom tiling continued this weekend but we came up against a few challenges with dodgy light wiring in the ceiling of our old house and terribly runny grout from Homebase (don't buy!).  <em>#life</em> <em>#diy</em></li><li>One thing I've enjoyed watching this week is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p08dnl67/staged">Staged on BBC iPlayer</a>; a brilliant comedy with Michael Sheen and David Tenant focusing on a real-world challenge with entertainment being on hold. (It was also entertaining to <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSimonEvans/status/1271914284918935556?s=20">get a message from the wrong Simon Evans</a> after my tweet)</li><li>Even though we had the new TV, we tried to setup an outdoor cinema in the garden Sunday evening using the projector and screen. In theory, it all works great but this isn't the best time of the year for a dusky evening movie with Summer Solstice approaching. <em>#life</em> <em>#entertainment</em> <em>#tech</em></li></ul>

<p><em>Week 25 of 2020 brings a Marshall Woburn speaker, noisy Prime notifications, Zoom salutes, immune footballers, Google Lighthouse, Donut, Overcast on Mac, turning 40, lockdown funerals, Father's Day, Little Fires Everywhere, The Other One and The Fever King.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Lockdown life has continued to provide endless deliveries and DIY chores around the house to make it more homely and comfortable. This week, we took delivery of new bathroom appliances for the newly decorated walls plus a new Marshall Woburn speaker for the “snug” living room. Bathroom fittings will have to wait but I took no time at all testing out the Woburn along with a Tidal subscription for hifi streaming.  I realise we have been indulging quite a lot through lockdown but we're actually saving a fortune in travelling costs so why not treat ourselves? <em>#life</em> <em>#tech</em></li><li>On the delivery front, the family Amazon Prime account has been taking an extra load lately with Father's Day and my birthday approaching. Again, very lucky but it does introduce challenges when trying to avoid all the order updates in emails and push notifications. <em>#life</em> <em>#tech</em></li><li>As we've all familiarised with video conferencing as a social norm, I raised a thought about <a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1272816194396000256">signing off with a salute or bow</a>. I'd love to see some other alternatives that bring a smile to your video calls with peers. <em>#tech</em></li><li>As the FA (prematurely) restarted the end of the season, I was curious to see what the experience was like - especially as some of the top-flight games were even broadcast on free-to-air channels for the first time in nearly 30 years. Seeing empty stadiums was a bizarre phenomena but I still can't believe players are safe to challenge each other in contact-sports whilst the 2m social distancing rule is still in place for the masses. <em>#sport</em> <em>#entertainment</em></li><li>Personal side projects have taken a bit of a break lately but I've still been supporting and promoting some of the collaboration projects; Andy continued to deliver on F1 Calendar, now with <a href="https://twitter.com/ay8s/status/1273366504629653505">optimal Google Lighthouse scores</a>, and On The Side saw record engagements from the previous week of Donut pairing, specifically on direct messages between members. <em>#sides</em> <em>#f1cal</em> <em>#ontheside</em></li><li>My new work Mac finally arrived this week after some COVID-19 delays so I was quick to get my local setup into a comfortable but minimal mode. To accompany the workflow, I also discovered an <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/PodcastMenu">unofficial Overcast menubar app called PodcastMenu</a>, allowing me to easily consume the podcasts I'm subscribed to and synchronise the playlists. <em>#tech</em> <em>#podcasts</em> <em>#work</em></li><li>This weekend marked two weeks until the end of my thirties <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/PodcastMenu">so I took to Twitter</a> for suggestions on how to wrap up the decade. Responses included mid-life crisis vehicles, piercings and drinking - the latter is easy, the other two quite tricky to accommodate through lockdown. <em>#life</em></li><li>Friday and Saturday was taken up with a couple funerals; one friend of the family on a video stream, another family down in Devon. The video stream was a surreal experience, unable to share emotional moments physically. The trip down to Devon wasn't exactly ideal neither, especially as we actually saw family members we couldn't greet or console with the typical hugs, but we managed to make the most of the trip with an afternoon on Babbacombe Bay beach.  This year is proving to be quite the mental challenge on so many levels – I'm looking forward to returning to some sort of "normal". <em>#life</em></li><li>Sunday was father's day, naturally providing quality time with the kids along with the treats of a cuppa-in-bed, <a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1274608993890115585">endless hugs</a> and some lovely gifts suited just for me (collection of coffee and laptop cover). The weather was glorious so I spent the best part of the day outdoors, including 2 hours in the hot-tub, resulting in a typical British sunburn. <em>#life</em></li><li>On TV, we've been getting in to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.10b8e985-383f-f08b-7d4f-2b46184bc772?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=B087Z6TLN8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=justukvawu-21">Little Fires Everywhere on Amazon Prime</a> (Witherspoon is brilliant as ever and the twists in the plot are never-ending) and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p08d6jb0/the-other-one?seriesId=p08d6jk0">The Other One on BBC</a> (enjoyable comedy with some favourite female actors). <em>#entertainment</em> <em>#tv</em></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3fQ4TH4">The Fever King by Victoria Lee</a> has got my attention back during my daily reading habit – the plot and characters have finally engaged and I'm thoroughly enjoying the sci-fi / techy / Harry Potter hybrid, even if it is probably aimed at a teenage audience. <em>#entertainment</em> <em>#books</em></li></ul>

<p><em>Week 26 of 2020 brings a new hybrid format, focused Mac workflows, tech prep for turning 40, short email addresses, Glasto archives, DJ Cruze revival and Amy Winehouse.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about audio versions of WeekNotes as a podcast? Read out the notes but also add a bit more commentary and ad-libbing for “natural” content. Would it be easier for me? Would anyone even listen? Think hybrid between the old Verbal Diary audio format (not as public) and regular WeekNotes text format (more formal). I'm going to give it a go for a few weeks to see how it turns out.</p>

<p><em>Week 30 of 2020 brings my first week off since Christmas, offline time in Rhodes, sci-fi books, loads of podcasts, the joy of magazines, swimming nearly 10km, Mindnodes and Leader Readme's.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Time off from work – no computer, tablet or TV</li><li>Instead, it was time <em>offline</em> with Kindle, podcasts and magazines</li><li>We apprehensively booked a last minute flight to a friend's hotel in Rhodes with flight restrictions lifted this week. </li><li>Flying through the lockdown was strange; Birmingham Airport was a ghost-town compared to the first Saturday of Summer Holidays every other year. The flight was at a hugely reduced capacity too – whether it was intentional or not – but certainly eased any concerns, even with face masks on permanently.</li><li>I read some sci-fi for the first time in <em>ages</em> and enjoyed it more than I expected; finished <a href="https://amzn.to/2CTgJT3">Aftershock by Marko Kloos</a> (fantasy multi-planet thriller) and started reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3hDrRlN">The Man Of Legends by Kenneth Johnson</a> (another curious thriller, this time with some funky time-travelling happening)</li><li>Caught up on my podcast cue in Overcast; <a href="https://www.relay.fm/adapt">Adapt</a> (on the reality of working solely on an iPad), <a href="https://fellow.app/supermanagers/">Super Managers</a> (on meeting formats and leadership), <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/podcasts">Wired</a> (general news and science, obviously very COVID-focused), <a href="https://defected.com/music/radio">Defected</a> (I need <em>some</em> tunes whilst I'm chilling), <a href="https://www.offmenupodcast.co.uk/">Off Menu</a> (and a giggle) and <a href="https://lockdownparent.podbean.com/">Lockdown Parenting</a> (plus a bit topical humour) </li><li>Enjoyed flicking through some paper-based mags; Total Film to catch up on the year's (delayed) movie releases and T3 to perv over some luxurious tech.</li><li>Swimming. <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/2525944#graph_date_range?chart_type=miles&amp;interval_type=week&amp;interval=202030&amp;year_offset=0">Lots of swimming</a>. And, according to Apple Watch, more daily fitness than when I'm working during lockdown.</li><li>In-between relaxation, I started using <a href="https://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> on my iPhone, creating mindmaps for iPad setup, Mac setup, <a href="http://ontheside.network">On The Side</a>, <a href="http://makelife.work">Make Life Work</a>, travel history (following a chat with the family) and any thoughts about work.</li><li>On the flight back, after listening to <a href="https://fellow.app/supermanagers/the-art-of-leadership-with-michael-lopp-rands-in-repose/">Michael Lopp on Super Managers</a>, I started thinking about writing a <em>Leader Readme</em> (like my <a href="https://github.com/si/readme">Manager Readme</a> but with preferred semantics and shift in career focus). I started outlining my thoughts and will return to it next week.</li></ul>

<p><em>Week 31 of 2020 brings some long-form writing, Make Life Work S04, Youtubing, education data storage, blood blisters and camping in St Ives.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following my break, this week was mostly about preparing Season 4 of <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/">Make Life Work</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/Si/status/1287683040890757120">asked Twitter</a> whether it should continue on this website or a dedicated site: a resounding response (of 18 votes) prompted me to sort something out on <a href="http://makelife.work/">makelife.work</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:core-embed/twitter {"url":"https://twitter.com/Si/status/1287683040890757120","type":"rich","providerNameSlug":"twitter","className":""} -->
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/Si/status/1287683040890757120
</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/twitter -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following that, I started looking at options - whether to continue with a Wordpress site or try something different like a static site on Netlify. Early POC's suggest the latter would work but could create a lot more effort. Pinecast offers websites out the box too but not much customisation (especially with short URL's etc). WordPress is familiar but comes at extra cost/setup efforts. Decisions, decisions…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before all this though, I started reaching out to potential guests. I was so delighted most invites were accepted. <a href="https://twitter.com/Rachael">Rachael Depp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/francastweets">Franca Hood</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/iiCe89">Dan Viddicombe</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/liz_e">Elizabeth Elcoate</a> all responded promptly and keenly. We've got August to organise recordings and I have one more guest up my sleeve who I'm sure will be game but I also like the idea of keeping one "secret" until later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To compliment the season announcement, I wanted to get some archives on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeaUX1e-dGtXIXRIImXN32Q">new YouTube channel</a>. Using a combination of <a href="https://duotone.shapefactory.co/?f=ea734f&amp;t=54009c&amp;q=_">Shapefactory</a>, <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAEDKuneuEo/CRpEF-6PrER-Y4zfflzgiQ/watch?utm_content=DAEDKuneuEo&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=sharebutton">Canva</a> and <a href="https://make.headliner.app/referral/simon.jobling_JQ8vDF">Headliner</a> (<em>get 2 weeks free Pro with that link</em>), this was quite straight forward. There's so much extra potential getting content on the world's biggest provider but, for MVP, it was a case of suitable images/videos to compliment the audio with useful links in descriptions. I also setup some short URL's on the new domain using the <code>sXXyYY</code> format.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Friday morning, (scheduled) social media posts went out to promote the new season and Youtube content. It's quite satisfying to see it all come together on time and receive some lovely feedback from my peers. (Thanks to my <a href="http://ontheside.network/">On The Side</a> comrades for their support through the week too.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additional to all this, Mrs J has been asking for some help to setup a website for her project at work. I can't share too much but it's a simple website with a booking system to generate leads in education so requires some data capture. My default option is WordPress with a plugin but it needs to be GDPR-compliant at least, with plenty security layers on some sensitive data. Trying to keep it simple (<em>stupid</em>) but it could open a can of worms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the health front, I got back into some running mid-week hitting over 8km but then disaster hit: nasty blood blisters on the end of my toes were showing the next day. I've struggled with these before and sounds like it could be due to tight shoes - many people recommend getting at least one size larger for running. Needless to say, I need to take time off to sort them out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Life side of things, I've got another break coming up next week. I'll try to blog some week notes but we'll be camping in St Ives so internet is likely to be dreadful. I'll be taking my laptop as I might get some time for side projects but setting zero expectations. I've neglected the bass guitar I got for my birthday and still have plenty to read so we'll see. Two weeks off work will be delightful though. Last week's "warm up" in Greece already feels like a distant memory… </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Week 32 of 2020 brings another Summer holiday, tech leadership woes, creating YouTube content and Slack icebreakers. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m sat on a hill in St Ives, sipping cider in the sun next to my caravan after an afternoon on the beach. And I’ve decided to write some week notes. Go figure.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll be taking a two week break from these (not like last time) but will return after the hols. In the mean time, I intend to make the most of Cornwall’s dire mobile signal, switch off to enjoy more reading and podcasts, plus quality time with the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>The Joys of Leadership&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been an interesting week with work. Whilst I’ve got a couple projects and teams to lead, there’s also a number of “foundational” initiatives going on to form some structure for the whole of our tech, product and commercial teams. Finding the right balance between the two main focuses ebbs and flows over time but this week has been mostly focused on projects and teams, particularly firefighting some challenging situations to ensure everyone is communicating and collaborating on key priorities. Doing this over Zoom and Dingtalk (Alibaba’s Slack equivalent) is not ideal and definitely contradicts my typical recommendation of talking to each other face-to-face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part of the job is also about documenting and reporting progress which, in an Agile environment, can prove difficult. Relying on Product Managers and Tech Leads to provide updates generally yields dreadful results and I end up chasing in the 11th hour for important detail. Ideally, I’d automate much of this but our internal tools don’t offer the flexibility yet. If there was a silver bullet to this, I’m sure it could be a moneymaker. Do share if you know of anything.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>More YouTube Content</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the sides (shameless plug alert), it’s been all about promoting Make Life Work season 4 this week. More YouTube content from the archives took up most the week, now with a refined process (to be blogged at some point). With the 2 week break approaching, I wanted to get all the content ready for publishing over two Friday’s. This week was Season 2 with Naomi, Kevin, Ashley, Marc and Dan (with some lovey engagement via Twitter) - next week will be Luke, Steve, Dom, Alex and Mike.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early metrics suggest it’s definitely got potential but I do want to look into YouTube’s features to enrich the content. It is Google’s baby so sure to lend towards better SEO as well. I also received an invite from Amazon to provide content on their upcoming podcast platform. When that launches, I’m looking forward to see if it gains much traction.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elsewhere, we’ve introduced a new app to On The Side to try drive engagement. It’s called Icebreaker which, as the name suggests, attempts to break the ice with groups of people using random questions. It’s gamified with gems and trivial questions plus they’ve provided a free community plan for our non-profit (thank you Ella) so I’m keen to test it out and tweak the frequency. Early interactions are mostly with the regulars so I’m going to look at how we can extend to the quieter members, maybe even reach out personally for direct feedback and suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>IRL, I’ve been trying to turn off properly but not very well. I spent a couple evenings “slapping the bass” after getting a new Fender cable (the one included didn’t last long) and reading my Kindle but the upcoming holiday will be a good time to turn off. I’ve brought my laptop away with me purely to focus on offline activities - start designs for Mrs J’s website, some mixing and music production, maybe even writing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s see how that goes and I’ll return in 2 weeks with further WeekNotes.  </p>

<p><em>Week 33 of 2020 brings a different tone and format being on holiday – more about family and leisure time – including digging holes, Tate, sea lions, cream tea, tin mines, Eden Project, bunnies, tropical birds and skittles.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monday, holes on the beach</strong>. Weather was glorious so we visited the local Carny Bay for a day of sand, sea and sun. Cornish roads are not the easiest to get around or park on but we found a cheeky roadside spot that was free for the day. It just left quite a steep hill for the kids to moan along. I got my dad hole mode on, excavating quite an impressive trench which got plenty appreciation from passers-by and nearby dads. Facilities were relatively good, nervous to use considering “eased lockdown”, but fresh tasty food from a local bbq shack and clean toilets with plenty sanitiser certainly helped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuesday, Tate St Ives and sea lion boat tour</strong>. With every family trip, we have to seek out a nearby gallery for art obsessed wifey. Plenty local heritage she appreciated but kids and myself not hugely impressed. After some snacks, we jumped on a boat tour to see sea lions bathing and resting. Eerily misty journey out to see was totally worth it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wednesday, cream tea and tin mines</strong>. Visited a quaint garden in the middle of nowhere serving scones and tea. Nice idea attracting foreign tourists but neither were that tasty despite decent reviews (should I contribute back online?). Best part of the journey was seeing some wild cattle by a derelict tin mine. Great opportunity to treat the iPhone wide angle lens (see featured image).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thursday, Eden Project</strong>. Underwhelming national treasure. Impressive structures and wonderful to see research going on but it needs more activities for families, plus food options are too spread out without enough variety. Family annual pass for £75 but you need a good reason to return. We also popped around the corner to see some family, as socially responsible as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Friday, quiet lazy one at the caravan</strong> with a trip to the supermarket as most local restaurants are fully booked through Summer #lockdownstaycation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Saturday, boiler woes and bunny tears</strong>. We woke up to realise the caravan boiler wasn’t working. Many phone calls later, we found a nearby hero able to source a replacement heating element and fix it same day. The day got worse when grandparents called to say one of the rabbits passed away overnight. Trying to tell any kids they’ve lost an animal is hard, especially unexpected. Being unable to say goodbye properly really bothered our son who’s planning to work with animals in the future. We also said goodbye to our Middlesbrough camping neighbours; addresses exchanged for the kids to pen pal each other - the lost art of social messaging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sunday, tropical birds and skittles</strong>. We head over to Paradise for an afternoon of tropical birds. Immediately, we were impressed. As we sat down for a picnic, we noticed parrots free flying around, sitting in the nearby tree. The entire park was really well managed with all the creatures looking healthy and happy. We even had a 15 minute discussion with a member of staff who told us some parrots can live to 80 years old. Following the animals, we found Country Skittles - a nearby restaurant featuring skittle alleys to enjoy with some pub grub. Perfect end to a lovely day.</p>

<p><em>Week 34 of 2020 brings a holiday cut short, healthcare challenges, selling websites, Michaela Coel, Feverwake and Yousician.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week was the third (and final) week of my Summer holidays for the year so there shouldn't have been much to cover. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, with a long solo drive home from Sandringham on a Sunday afternoon and some topics worth mentioning, I decided to record an audio version for this week making the most of the "free" time.</p>

<p><em>Week 35 of 2020 brings urgent surgery, new Make Life Work tech, Tenet, tyres and Sandringham. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s outline this week’s events and updates in the interests of minimal effort on our last bank holiday:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Monday was back to work after 2 weeks off - didn’t take long to get back into the swing of things, and at least the first commute was straight forward. Funny now inbox damage was minimal - it’s all in our Slack equivalent (Ding) instead!</li><li>Tuesday, I started prep for restarting Make Life Work with a brand new website. Rather than new tech, I just opted for a default Wordpress site and manually moved the content across (15 episodes), tidying it up in the process. Plan is to have it ready for the first episode next week. </li><li>Wednesday, we braved the local cinema for the first time since lockdown to see the globally anticipated Tenet. Unfortunately, we were all completely underwhelmed following the hype: watching with glasses and face mask was awful but the movie (for me) lacked character depth and actual plot. </li><li>Thursday, I started preparing tech for recording Make Life Work from next week. Previously, I used my work machine to record and iPad to edit but now I’ve got a new Mac. This series, I’m going to try using Zoom with local audio recordings. This should lend well to extra YouTube video content (guests permitting) and I’ve installed <a href="https://reincubate.com/camo/">Reincubate Camo</a> for external camera support using iPhone’s 4K tech rather than the pathetic Mac FaceTime camera. I also ordered a new <a href="http://Samson Q2U Recording and Podcasting Pack - USB/XLR Dynamic Microphone with Accessories https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001R747SG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_XHktFbYQH3KJ5">Samson Q2U mic</a> following plenty reviews and comparisons that should yield much better audio quality. </li><li>Friday, we noticed a screw in the car tyre so a visit to the local tyre repair shop was in order. I’d typically scrimp on budget tyres but, with it towing a bulky caravan quite a lot this summer, actually opted for some premium replacements. </li><li>Saturday was spent driving to and from Sandringham to collect my birthday princess from a week camping with grandparents. It was ideal time to catch up on podcasts, listening to Wired’s thoughts on returning to the office and Rob &amp; Josh attempt parenting through lockdown. </li><li>Sunday was mostly spent at Northampton General with the boy needing urgent surgery. Sparing the detail, he’s now in recovery but the NHS staff were wonderful caring for him, operating on him within 3 hours of admission. What did bother me was the amount of people ignoring face mask protocol - no wonder we’re heading towards another local lockdown / second wave. </li></ul>

<p><em>Week 36 of 2020 brings the start of Season 4, Wordpress woes, a family side project, guinea pigs, wrestling, learning disabilities and £20 movie passes.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Wordpress Headaches</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I tried to configure a brand new website for the <a href="http://sijobling.com/makelifework/" data-type="page" data-id="5906">Make Life Work Podcast</a>, I struggled to get the domain working correctly through Cloudflare on an existing shared hosting plan. In the end, I brought a dedicated <a href="https://www.easywp.com">EasyWP</a> plan along with a <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/comodo/positivessl/">basic PositiveSSL certificate</a> all through Namecheap and fixed the Cloudflare <em>DNS Only</em> settings (following a ticket to support). I've never had so many issues with domains - maybe I'm losing it…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, it's finally coming together now with most the core content available. The website still needs a bit of love on the performance and optimisation plus some extra configurations before the podcast feed and newsletter are migrated but we're getting close to an MLP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:video {"id":6748,"align":"wide"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide"><video controls src="http://sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MLW-MVP.mov"></video><figcaption>MLW MVP demo</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:video -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The First Recording</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn't just about the website this week –&nbsp;the first episode was recorded with brand designer, <a href="https://elizabethelcoate.com">Liz Elcoate</a>. After the Summer break, I've actually got some new kit –&nbsp;brand new Mac for my birthday, <a href="https://amzn.to/3h5dztv">Samson Q2U mic</a> and tripod stand for iPhone with <a href="https://reincubate.com/camo/">Camo</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;so I was a little nervous of how it might all come out. Even with local test recordings, I wasn't entirely convinced it would work remotely so, thanks to a brief message On The Side, <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk">Juan</a> jumped on a Zoom call where audio and video both came through beautifully. Then I could relax and enjoy the conversation with Liz which will be released in the next week or so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Acceler8ed</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This weekend, I also spent an afternoon brainstorming and rapid prototyping a website for my wife's new project at work, <a href="https://acceler8.education">Acceler8 Education</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, Wordpress to the rescue and, this time, without all the nightmares of Make Life Work. It allowed us to focus on the content, functionality and basic formatting with a focus on MVP. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With kids returning to school from lockdown, quite far behind with their personal development, it's optimal time to promote private tutoring. Potential leads are already flying in from friends on the socials so, naturally, all the popular handles were registered on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acceler8edu/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/acceler8edu/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/acceler8edu">Twitter</a> to support the promotion, opting with <em>@acceler8edu</em> for consistency and succinctness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>New Guinea</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At home, Princess decided to spend her birthday money on not one <em>but two</em> new guinea pigs (apparently recommended for companionship). Both kids really enjoyed cuddling up to them – I'd often enter the living room to find squeaking creatures cooing over the furry little things. We even had a little fun with them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt0PJPrEXFI&amp;feature=youtu.be">watching other talking guineas on Youtube</a> <em>#GuineaPigInception</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt0PJPrEXFI\u0026feature=youtu.be","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"youtube","className":"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What To Watch</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amongst all the side projects, we've amazingly found time to enjoy some new TV content:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80203525">Peanut Butter Falcon on Netflix</a> –&nbsp;a wonderful story of a Downs kid chasing his dream, brilliantly performed by Shia, Zack and Dakota.</li><li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bp2zq4">There She Goes on iPlayer</a> –&nbsp;another story about a disabled character, this time a dark comedy with David Tennant and Jessica Hynes braving a very difficult topic on raising a child with learning disabilities.</li><li><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/mulan/2jlgPK4K0ilR">Mulan on DisneyPlus</a> (Premium) –&nbsp;why suffer the (current) terrible cinema experience when you could watch the latest Disney live action from the comfort of your own home and at half the price? In all seriousness, it was probably one of the best live action remakes of the series, despite some questionable SFX thrown in. The family definitely enjoyed it anyway –&nbsp;worth the £20 single movie pass after all.</li></ul>

<p><em>Week 37 of 2020 brings online car sales, more hospital visits, iCloud sync fail, Joe Wicks, chasing reports, Google Meet, Zoom PT, SDLC's, Cazoo and Monzo.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a week! I write this on Monday evening after quite a crazy weekend. Let’s get into it with a "dear diary" format.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Monday 7th September</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another trip to Northants General, this time scheduled for Mrs J as we try to understand the pains she’s been going through the past few months. At least I was able to wait nearby in the waiting room with a café this time - better than other recent experiences, stuck in the car park. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tuesday 8th September </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We got Mum a new iPhone for her birthday this year after she’s been struggling on iPhone 5 for the past year. As the go-to tech support guy, naturally it was my job to get her setup but to find it hadn’t synchronised with iCloud for over 5 years was quite alarming - apparently due to lack of local storage for sync to function. Removing a few unused apps helped kick it all off, then migration was plain sailing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier in the day, I got back into some fitness with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQt9r6bieE0&amp;t=10s">20min Joe Wicks workout</a> in the living room. It was tough and took plenty time to recover but it felt good to get back into some exercise.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQt9r6bieE0\u0026t=10s","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"youtube","className":"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQt9r6bieE0&amp;t=10s
</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Wednesday 9th September </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesdays are when I typically have to setup the weekly reports for our product managers and tech leads to go through. We use an internal arbitrary tool which is nowhere near as versatile as Confluence but I’m finding little tricks to simplify the process. That’s the easy part though. Chasing and formatting the content into a cohesive standard takes much more manual effort than should be required. I’d love to automate this but tools don’t bode well towards it at the moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also arranged a short Zoom call with an <a href="http://ontheside.network">On The Side</a> member as part of our <em>#drink-buddies</em> channel (using <a href="https://www.donut.app">Donut</a> for random pairings). It was lovely to have a F2F chat with Luisa, chatting through our personal working arrangements and how we can support others in the community on side projects. <em>Side note</em>; Google Meet is nowhere near as good as Zoom. Despite being such a monopoly, not all Google’s tools are market leaders. </p>

<h2>Thursday 10th September </h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bit of a strange one this but remember those <a href="http://sijobling.com/blog/team-building-workouts/" data-type="post" data-id="5642">group PT sessions</a> I blogged about previously to help team morale and wellbeing? We tried a Zoom workout at lunch today, trying to keep up with Mr Wicks on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr-p7TikhPI">another brutal HIIT YouTube session</a>. Technically, it worked quite well - we don’t have to see each other but having open comms to <s>chat</s> <strong>shout</strong> and support each other definitely improves encouragement plus the cheeky bants diffuse some awkward and difficult moments. </p>

<h2>Friday 11th September</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As part of my current role, I’ve been tasked with establishing some standards and guidance around software delivery. As I’ve observed multiple teams’ process and challenges, I’ve pulled together a set of standard processes as a guide all teams can cross reference towards the ideal software delivery lifecycle (SDLC). Needless to say, no mean feat with tens of teams and “design by committee” so I took as many tech leads as possible through it Friday morning to mixed reactions. Some realised the value in it whilst others challenged some detail. In hindsight, quite a success considering typical techie’s attitudes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I tried to unwind after quite an intense day, I took back to my bass guitar (one of the daily habits in my Ticktick, regularly reminding me to practice). With Kool &amp; The Gang's Ronald Bell passing away this week (RIP), it made sense to learn "Celebration". Check out how bad I was…</p>

<p>Finally, let's not forget it's #<strong>FatFriday</strong> (obligatory bacon sandwich breakfast) and, ideally, <strong>Dress UP Friday</strong> (for all us lockdown remote workers who are tired of wearing t-shirts). </p>

<h2>Saturday 12th September</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Mrs J returning to work (school) this week, we've come to realise the Land Rover she uses isn't ideal for motorway driving. However, she needs something high up to accommodate a previous slipped disc and it's the one of few vehicles capable of towing our 2,000kg caravan. Checking around, we realised a smaller 2.0 or 2.2 Discovery Sport was capable so we shopped around and ended up on new online dealer, <a href="http://kazoo.co.uk">Cazoo</a> - a disruptor in the car retail sector. Prices were competitive and, having an internal contact, I felt comfortable continuing the purchase unlike traditional car sales. However, being such a large investment and difficult to judge the actual dimensions, we ventured out to the nearest dealer to size up. It felt naughty but after all the years of dodgy dealers doing me over, it was time for some comeuppance. I did like how the vehicle is reserved whilst we go through the motions of finance deals plus they give you 24 hours to accept and proceed. Nice touch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sunday 13th September</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the finance deal lingering in my inbox overnight (always good to sleep on these things), I pressed the necessary buttons in the morning and went through the mobile verification steps in a seamless process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now it was time to sell the old one. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mrs J posted on the local Facebook community yielding a number of false leads but one character was pretty determined, turned up on the door same day and counter-offered. We were slightly hesitant to his offer but it was no nonsense and, asking around, seemed reasonable after all. Time to <a href="https://monzo.com">Monzo</a> the funds, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sold-bought-vehicle">transfer ownership online</a> (no V5 log books needed) and it was all done in a matter of minutes. The future of private car sales and with a lot less stress.</p>

<p><em>Week 38 of 2020 brings a brand new Make Life Work website, Funky House Finesse revival, more HIIT with Wicks, oily fish, team reshuffles, Discovery Sport, Dennis Nilsen, Gmail sibling tricks, Zoom hacks and Apple major update frustrations.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s keep things relatively simple this week with some brief outlining and tweet-bait:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Main side project focus this week has been preparing the start of Make Life Work S04 with edit of Liz Elcoate’s episode and launching <a href="https://makelifeworkpodcast.com/">the new website</a>. Both went to plan, despite some media 404’s on the Wordpress <a href="https://castos.com/seriously-simple-podcasting/">Seriously Simple Podcasting plugin</a> which required a last minute switch to <a href="https://create.blubrry.com/resources/powerpress/">Blubrry's PowerPress</a>. </li><li><em>#FinesseFriday</em> is still going strong as well, this week revisiting the <a href="https://www.housefinesse.com/onephatdj/funky-house-finesse-march-2009/">Funky House Finesse debut show</a>. The hashtag was meant to be a Summer thing but I’m going to keep going considering social engagements and downloads seem to be quite healthy from it. </li><li>Fitness is getting back on track with two more Joe Wicks HIIT sessions this week. Unfortunately, I have noticed my bones feeling quite stiff recently so need to proceed carefully. In the mean time, <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOykeQ">glucosamine with Omega-3</a> ordered on Prime plus oily fish in the weekly food shop as an additional aide. </li><li>With work, focus is on new team prep, getting the Product and Tech Leads aligned on direction along with clearing up the scope boundaries. We’re also lining up announcements for the SDLC to get the whole of Tech and Product onboard. </li><li>Saturday, we took delivery of the new Discovery Sport after last week’s Cazoo order. Fantastic customer service from Darren (our delivery specialist) plus the vehicle is definitely an upgrade to “Disco Daisy” (our previous model).</li><li>Entertainment wise, we’ve got into <a href="https://www.itv.com/hub/des/2a7844">ITV’s Des</a> - a dramatisation about Dennis Nilsen, featuring some fantastic acting from David Tenant and Co and thrilling story-telling.</li></ul>

<p><em>Week 39 of 2020 brings home alone, beer fail, remote group workouts, Liz Elcoate, Amazon Podcasts, free Jira and unexpected Shopify charges.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sticking to some outlined bullet points this week, simply for convenience and efficiency. (For reference, it took about 20-25 minutes to write. Nailing it.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>This was my first week alone in the house since lockdown came into place. It was very strange being the soul human around for a few days but, unfortunately, the boy’s return to school following surgery was slightly premature with further pains returning. A mid-week trip to A&amp;E confirmed it was nothing serious (thankfully) but further R&amp;R was suggested.</li><li>Dietary adjustments came into play this week with an attempt to introduce oily fish for aching joints (see featured image) and results from an intolerance test confirmed beer is a likely source of my abdominal pains. Age is a b*tch when it takes out one of your favourite foods. (It also prompted me to cancel the Brew Republic subscription I’ve recently been enjoying - time to find a gin/wine alternative)</li><li>I managed to squeeze in three Joe Wicks workouts this week thanks to a regularly scheduled “meeting” with a colleague to help encourage each other. Squatting and lunging over WhatsApp calls with colleagues is admittedly a strange sensation but a brilliant way to break down boundaries and add a comedic element to your daily workouts.</li><li><a href="http://makelifeworkpodcast.com">Make Life Work</a> returned to the “airwaves” on Friday with Liz Elcoate providing the first episode of Season 4. As discussed on the show, the hard part is really all the preparation and promotion rather than the recording. Even post-production was quite straight forward (although I’ll admit now I kept it simple rather than going down the <a href="http://sijobling.com/blog/nicholas-parsons-technique/" data-type="post" data-id="6250">Nicholas Parsons</a>’ route). </li><li>With the new website and feed, there was some extra admin to ensure new episodes were pushed out. My suspicions were squashed though as an early test showed Overcast first, Amazon second and Apple third without issues.</li><li>I also tried something new with <a href="http://patreon.com/makelifework">early access on Patreon</a> along with a video trailer for the socials (using Headliner). I’ve got beta access to a similar tool I’ll try this week to see how it compares but functionality does seem slightly simpler.</li><li>Earlier in the week, I discovered Jira now provides free plans for up to 10 users. With work shifting away to some internal proprietary alternatives, I’m keen to keep on top of Jira’s latest features (being the industry standard for what I do) so setup a plan for my side projects, tinkering around with some of the “next gen” features. For now, MLW is a kanban setup whilst TeachMugs (see next point) is Scrum.</li><li>Earlier in the year, Mrs J had a genius idea to setup a website selling mugs for teachers, so we snapped up <a href="http://TeachMugs.com">teachmugs.com</a>. Naturally, it fell by the way side but following an unexpected Shopify invoice for $28 following the initial 3-month free trial (some email warnings wouldn’t go amiss Shopify!), I’ve decided to give it one last try. I’ve connected Printful to the website with a couple sample products I’ve now ordered to test fulfilment. They should arrive in the next week or so to know what timelines and quality are like. Then we can pull together a fag-packet business plan on running costs/ROI.</li></ul>
