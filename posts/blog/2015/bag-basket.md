When you're next shopping online, take note of where you add products to. I bet it's wrongly named.

It's only recently I've noticed this mistake but I guarantee the majority of websites get it wrong.

"Add to bag". "View shopping bag".

Think about it.

When you go shopping in the real world, you don't add items to a bag – you place them in a **basket** (or trolley). It's only after you go through the checkout to pay for those items do they go in a bag. In essence, this is your parcel at the end of the online purchase.

If you were to add items to your bag before you pay for them, you'd be treated as a potential thief. Let's not go down that route for now.

Lesson learned? Think about your language and how it correlates to the user's perception when designing your experience.
