Taking inspiration from [Trovster's links feed](https://www.trovster.com/links/articles), I've decided to setup my own directory of links found from around the web with my own personal stance on them in a [new Bookmarks section](http://sijobling.com/bookmarks).

It harks back to the days of Web 2.0 apps like del.icio.us where people publicly shared their bookmarks, organising with suitable taxonomy (and machine tags) and I often reshared on my Twitter account which helped grow my audience.

Once I've got a workflow in place that helps me curate these in an efficient and suitable approach, I'll be sure to post something too. For now, I'm experimenting with a [Ticktick](https://ticktick.com) x [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) recipe.
