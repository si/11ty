Through the month of May, I am setting myself the lofty goal of running a marathon for Macmillan Cancer Support.

After losing my uncle to cancer last year, I realised the importance of Macmillan as they helped to provide palliative care for my family and ongoing support following his passing. They are a hugely valuable organisation to anyone who suffers through the pain of cancer, directly or indirectly. As such, I wanted to give back to them by pushing beyond my comfort zone with this running challenge.

I'm not particularly athletic, nor strong at running, so I thought a reasonable goal for the month would be a typical marathon (26.2 miles). Spread out over the month, that's either a mile a day or 2 miles every other. I'd love to smash the goal but let's be realistic here. Even running to the train station from work puts me out of breath, causing me days of discomfort as well.

As a data junkie, I will be recording all my exercise on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/sijobling) using my Apple Watch for accurate measurements of pace, heart rate and all the other juicy info available. This will also ensure I do indeed complete the 26.2 mile challenge and provide evidence as such.
