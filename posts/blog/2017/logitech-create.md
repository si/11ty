When I was hunting for a keyboard to compliment my shiny new iPad Pro, the official suggestion irked me with the lack of protection for the back of the iPad. I also thought the price was quite high for what was, essentially, a keyboard and cover.

I then discovered the Logitech Create. With full surrounding protection and a much more wallet-friendly price tag, it definitely caught my attention. I watched a few Youtube video demonstrations and read plenty reviews comparing the products - I was sold.

After receiving the product promptly (with free postage too - always worth shopping around on eBay), I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging. A delightful magnetic seal kept the solid packaging in place and definitely set the tone for quality. Setup was extremely simple. Even though connecting the iPad to the protective case seemed a little awkward at first, it's held in place ever since and without worry. Keyboard connectivity through the smart connector required a couple prompts, then it just worked. 

Keyboard response is brilliant. No skipped keys when typing, delightfully subtle sounds on the key suction and variable backlights make for a moody evening use. Build quality is perfect, comparable to Apple's high standards.

I even had a friend who uses the official Apple keyboard test it. He was pleasantly surprised and even considered swapping over. 

The only downside to the Create is the weight. Due to the full fibre wrap, it definitely doubles the weight of the whole device - but it's comparably lighter than a 13" laptop. Considering the extended keyboard practically turns the iPad into a fully operational computer, I don't see this as a problem. I no longer commute to and from the office with my 15" Macbook Pro, instead taking my 12.9" iPad Pro as my travel companion. In fact, this very post was typed up using my new setup – it's actually allowed me to blog more. (I'll spare my iPad setup for another post.)

All in all, I'm very impressed with the Logitech Create and highly recommend it to anyone else who has an iPad Pro, either 9.7" or 12.9" versions, who are looking to upgrade with a complimentary keyboard. A great product, fairly priced, delivering above-and-beyond performance.
