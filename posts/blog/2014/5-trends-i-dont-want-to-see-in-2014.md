1. **White text over blurred photography.** Quite an elegant style when it was new but now it's just a lazy solution to designing a homepage.
2. **Parallax scrolling stories.** (And hijacked scrolling behaviour whilst we're on it). Scrolling may be natural but my fore finger can only take so much.
3. **iOS7 clones.** Some of the guidelines were questionable when it was released so why copy something that a large demographic won't appreciate?
4. **Hamburger icons on desktops.** Originally, a nice idea to resolve the limited screen estate on mobile devices but started leaking into desktop interfaces last year. It's a catch-all solution for a "consistent" responsive UX.
5. **"Top X" blog posts.** Oh, the irony.
