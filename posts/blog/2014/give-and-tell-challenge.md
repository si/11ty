Yesterday, I was nominated for the Ice Bucket Challenge. I declined.Â Let me explain.

There's no denying the [#ALSIceBucketChallenge](http://wikipedia.org/en/Ice_Bucket_Challenge) has been a huge success.Â It has set an unprecedented benchmark forÂ charitable viral campaigns.Â Everyone from your next-door neighbour to the biggest celebrities have acceptedÂ the craze in the name of motor neurone disease.

WhenÂ a friend's father nominated me yesterday, I was left withÂ a bit ofÂ dilemma.

I'm all for charity. I give up a lot of my time for local communities and regularly donate to charity.

On the flip side, I felt compelled to accept the challenge purely because of peer pressure. I have no direct association with ALS/MND so I was doing it for the wrong reasons.

It turned out I wasn't alone. A [few](https://medium.com/@boagworld/the-ice-bucket-challenge-e0663fbf6544) [people](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/give-and-tell-challenge) in theÂ web community were in a similar boatÂ â€“ [Dan James](http://www.ceoblues.com/archive/2014/august/giveandtell) puts it best:

> Something about the ice bucket challenge irks me. There is a gimmickry about it that takes away from the charity. The important thing seems to have become watching people pour ice water on their heads. The donations, the charity, the giving, has become a side effect (with indisputable financial results) of a viral sensation.

With that in mind, I have "wimped out"Â andÂ decided to name theÂ charities that mean something to meÂ instead.

My wife and I bothÂ [donate monthly toÂ Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/donate).Â We have both witnessedÂ family members suffer from The C WordÂ in the past soÂ it's a no-brainer for us. There have been major leaps forward with cancer research in the past year andÂ this wouldn't be possible without the donations made globally. I have also donated an extra Â£10Â this week to signify this call to action.

I amÂ also signed up for the [Payday Pennies](http://www.thebigcharitywhipround.co.uk/) scheme through work.Â They basically round your monthly pay packet down to the nearest pound, donating the remaining pennies directly to charity.

Time for the nominations:
