Last month I ran a **PETALS Advent**: a daily video drop with short, practical prompts to help teams build healthier habits. Think of it as a 24-day nudge for psychological safety, feedback loops, and better ways of working — one micro-lesson at a time.

I wanted the series to feel light and doable. Each episode was designed to be under a couple of minutes, with just one idea per day. It was also a small personal experiment: could I outline, record, edit, publish, and promote a video *every day* without burning out?

### What the series covered

PETALS already covers a broad range of team health topics, so I used the Advent format to explore a mix of:

- **Safety and trust** (how people feel showing up and speaking up)
- **Feedback and candour** (how to help teams have better conversations)
- **Clarity and alignment** (what it means to know what “good” looks like)
- **Rhythm and rituals** (tiny behaviours that create consistency)
- **Celebration and reflection** (making space to notice progress)

It wasn’t about deep dives — it was about small prompts that are easy to try in the next stand-up, retro, or 1:1.

### The process (what worked)

A few things made the daily cadence possible:

- **Batch planning**: I sketched the full 24-day outline early so I wasn’t scrambling for topics.
- **Repeatable structure**: each video had the same arc — _context → prompt → one action_.
- **Lightweight tooling**: I recorded quickly, used Descript for edits, and scheduled via Buffer.

Even with that rhythm, some days still felt like a sprint. But the process held up better than expected and taught me a lot about shipping fast without losing quality.

### Popular posts (by view count)

Below is a starting list of the best-performing Advent videos from the playlist. I’ll update the numbers once the view counts are pulled directly from YouTube analytics.

### What I learned

- **Small prompts travel far.** The shortest episodes often sparked the most comments because they were easy to try immediately.
- **Consistency builds trust.** Showing up daily reminded me (and the audience) that trust grows through repetition.
- **Systems beat motivation.** A simple, repeatable workflow was the only reason I could keep it up.
