Today marksÂ [Commodore 64's 30th birthday](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19055707).Â It would be wrong to let this milestone pass without a few commentsâ€¦

The Commodore 64 introduced me to computers at the tender young age of 7. Thanks to my father, I was programming my first "game" by the age of 8 and I was hooked.

If it wasn't for those early years learning about the core principles of coding, limited resources (64kb â€“ kids nowadays don't know what they've got!) and, most of all, the patience of making something work, I wouldn't be where I am today, working in the digital industry.

Happy birthday, Commodore 64. Thanks for the (screechy) memories.
