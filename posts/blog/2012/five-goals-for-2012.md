It may seem a bit late in the year to be writing such a post about annual goals but it was something I considered last December that I never documented. My thinking is if I formally write them down, I'll be more inclined to attempt them. So, here goesâ€¦

## 1\. Get an article publishedÂ [âœ”](http://sijobling.com/portfolio/no-more-excuses/ "No More Excuses")

I've worked in the web industry for over ten years now learning a lot along the way. I want to share some of that knowledge with my peers, not just on my blog but in a published medium.

## 2\. Create an app

I've created many websites in the past but none of them are user generated. I want to address this by making an app for others to use, either in a web or native mobile form (probably the former). I've a few ideas in the pipeline so there's no excuses there.

## 3\. Redesign _and releaseÂ_ this websiteÂ [âœ”](http://sijobling.com/blog/clean-slate/ "A Clean Slate")

Like most designers, I redesign and redesign my own website that never get released. This year, I'm determined to release something, even if it starts with a very simple start. I've made good progress on a [logotype-come-ligature concept](http://dribbble.com/sijob/projects/10226-Si) so we'll see where that goes.

## 4\. Produce my first house track

I've been producing my [house music podcast](http://www.onephatdj.com/) for seven years now but never produced my own track. Many friends and listeners of the show have asked so I think it's time to take the plunge and see/hear what I can come up with.

## 5\. Push Funky House Finesse forward

The podcast has built up a loyal following over the many years, downloaded by thousands every month and broadcast on a growing network of radio stations. I'm very proud with how it's grown. I want to take it to the next level, get more exposure by syndicating it on more stations, possibly collaborate with some musical peers.

* * *

As each goal is reached, I'll tick them off (the first one became a reality this month in .net magazine so that was relatively easy). I'll be optimistic here. There's no reason why all five can't be done in 2012.
