The other day, I was astounded at the progress my son has made in learning.

He is fascinated with animals and books. If he's not watching [Deadly 60](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/shows/deadly-60) or any other BBC natural history programmes, he's flicking through his growing library of animal literature. I'm particularly proud of his interest in literacy – it's not been forced on him, he just enjoys books. A rarity in today's youth.

When he got into bed, he noticed one of the pages in his Deadly 60 book had lost it's dog-eared corner:

> “Mummy, you've lost my goshawk.”

Without hesitation or any prompting, he turned to the contents, scanned the list:

> “G-O-S… Goshawk. Eight-Zero”

He then flicked through the pages, counting past 50, 60, 70… “_Eight Zero!”_

He had found his Goshawk.

> “See Mummy, I’ve found my Goshawk now.”

For a five year old, I'm amazed at three things here:

1. His ability to scan book contents looking for the word using phonetics
2. Counting beyond 20 (the benchmark for Key Stage 1)
3. His extensive knowledge of lesser-known animals

This probably bears little interest to other people. It just seemed like a momentous occasion that should be recorded on my son's development.
