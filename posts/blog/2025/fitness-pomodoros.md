This idea hit me in the gym, then got shaped in the pool. That’s how most of my stuff comes together; push myself physically, then let my head wander until it clicks.

In the gym, I noticed something simple. My sets, rests and the clock on the wall lined up perfectly with Pomodoro timers. Twenty-five minutes of focus, five minutes of recovery. That’s how I work – why not train the same way?

Later, in the pool, I broke it down further.

_What if you split 25 minutes of exercise into five 5-minute chunks, each with a one-minute cooldown?_

Suddenly it wasn’t “finding a spare hour for the gym.” It was just one Pomodoro. That small shift made the whole thing feel more doable.

The more I thought about it, the more it made sense:

- Research shows even **five minutes of daily exercise** can boost strength, endurance and mental wellbeing, especially in people who are otherwise sedentary ([Tom’s Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-hour-long-workouts-new-study-says-this-5-minute-routine-improves-your-strength-and-mental-health), 2024).

- Short bursts of moderate movement have been linked to lower blood pressure and reduced risk of heart disease ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/lower-your-blood-pressure-5-minutes-exercise-a-day-study-2024-11), 2024).

- Like Pomodoros at work, structured intervals build consistency and reduce decision fatigue – a key factor in making habits stick ([Lally et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21086209/)).

- And the overlap with mental health is huge. Swimming especially is rhythmic and meditative, shown to reduce stress and anxiety ([Swim England, 2018](https://www.swimming.org/swimengland/impact-of-swimming-report/)).

It’s not a brand new thought, either. Others have played with the idea of “fitness Pomodoros” before; from early blogs like _[End of Three Fitness](https://www.endofthreefitness.com/pomodoro-technique-fitness/?)_ (2014) to more recent Medium posts about [structuring workouts in 25-minute chunks](https://medium.com/%40muhammadahmadatca/how-i-used-the-pomodoro-technique-to-finally-stick-to-my-workout-routine-31556cb9fc4a?).

What I’m playing with here is an iteration: weaving in cool-downs, mental health, and the way it integrates into a Pomodoro-shaped calendar.

What I like most is the flexibility. You can skip a Pomodoro when the day’s stacked, double up if you’ve got the energy, or fit them around meetings. I’ve even started setting all my work meetings as 25 or 50 min Pomos. It means when I’m planning my day, I can see exactly where fitness or wellness can fit in.

And once you stick with it, you find a natural rhythm. It stops feeling like a system and just becomes habit. Consistent cues, after a call, before lunch, between emails, help it embed and soon you’re not relying on willpower.

You’re just following the rhythm, like laps in a pool or steps on a treadmill.

Of course, it’s not perfect. Five-minute bursts won’t replace every fitness goal, and staying consistent takes effort. Some people might find it interrupts their flow, or feels too easy at times. But for anyone juggling work, health and headspace who are slaves to their calendars, Fitness Pomodoros offer a way to balance it all without overthinking.

Born in the gym, refined in the pool, applied in my calendar. That’s **Fitness Pomodoros**.

I’m now up on my gym Pomodoro, drafting this out, and need to get ready for work.
