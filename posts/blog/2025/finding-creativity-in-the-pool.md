Like many folks in tech, my head’s usually full of noise; podcasts, playlists, Slack messages, meeting notes. But I’ve found an unlikely place where my brain slows down just enough for creativity to catch up: the swimming pool.

## **Running fills the time, swimming clears the mind**

Three mornings a week, I hit the gym before work. I start with a 30-minute run, usually fuelled by a podcast or a mix from Glitterbox, Defected, or even my [own House Finesse show](http://housefinesse.com). It’s productive, energising and full-on.

Then I swim.

No headphones, no music, no podcasts. Just me, four tiled walls, and water. It’s not inspiring on the surface, but it’s where the best ideas tend to bubble up.

## **Creative sparks in the quiet moments**

There’s something about the repetition and stillness that opens up space in my brain. Without distractions, I find myself drifting into ideas; not just for ALL THE side projects but also family stuff and work.

It reminded me: creativity often needs silence, not stimulation.

No browsers. No doom-scrolling. Just stillness.

## **The annoying bit: trying to capture it**

The ideas come but the problem is I can’t easily do anything with them.

My Apple Watch isn’t very helpful with wet fingers (I even struggle to end or pause my workouts).

I can’t exactly start shouting notes into my phone around the pool either - the strangers would be worried.

So, at the moment, I try to brain dump as soon as I get back to the locker room. But inevitably, some of them slip away.

## Where I’m heading with this

I’m still figuring it out, but I’ve started experimenting:

- Taking more tech-free time outside the pool (quiet walks and screen-free lunch breaks

- Bouncing ideas around with ChatGPT hands-free whilst driving - remarkably convenient when you're stuck in the car for up to an hour

- Finding faster ways to get notes down straight after a workout, possibly using some AI to structure them thoughts

- Letting go of the need to capture _everything_ and trusting the best ideas will come back

## **Over to you**

If you’re feeling creatively blocked, maybe try doing less. Let yourself be bored. Go for a swim. Or a quiet walk. See what comes up.

Just don’t expect your tech to help while you’re dripping wet.
