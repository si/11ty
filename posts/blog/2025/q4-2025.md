### **October**

- Chatted with university students in New York about the PETALS framework and how it has helped teams with improving psychological safety through real-world case studies (annoyingly, the recording didn’t work very well, only capturing my audio).
- Test print of Lizzie’s first book using Amazon KDP and Canva for designs. Lots of lessons learned, but quite happy with the first-ever attempt with books.
- I started using an “AddToCal” tag on my TickTick items that automatically sync with my “personal” Google Calendar. It’s been really useful to see how I spend my time and handy for looking back for posts like this.
- Had an idea: Can we feed all the House Finesse mix tracks and DJs into an LLM for easier discoverability? Not much work on this, but noted down and shared here for visibility.
- Saw The Bodyguard at Oxford’s New Theatre - birthday present for wifey. Impressive performances but as a Whitney fanboy, my expectations weren’t quite met.
- Hosted our first Lean Coffee Leaders MK at Rightmove offices, bringing together local tech leaders to share and compare similar challenges.
- Hosted our first Lean Coffee Leaders MK on 15 October - a casual space for local tech leaders to meet up over a lunchtime coffee, discuss their own work focus and challenges, and share the knowledge with fellow peers. I’m starting it off as an organic word of mouth invite first but we will open it up later in 2026.
- Spent some time with apprenticeship students through Working Options, sharing some personal insights on working in tech for the past 30 years.
- Organised the Multipack 20th anniversary curry in Birmingham but couldn’t make it due to a clashing family birthday. We need to organise another one for Q1 that I have to attend.
- Spent a bit of time on [unstyled.com](https://unstyled.com) - my studio name - showcasing some of the projects I’ve worked on over the past few years.
- Tried some “Hotpod yoga” on a free trial in Weedon Bec. Safe to say it’s not for me yet, way too intense and difficult for a beginner who needs some more practice in a smaller space where I can be corrected.
- Family had a week at Disneyland Paris whilst I looked after the dogs. Gave me a chance to spend some much-needed time with my best mate.
- Introduced our fourth member to the PETALS team, Sertan - someone who has also witnessed the birth and evolution of the framework, and is also super passionate about building cool stuff.

### **November**

- The Boy returned home from uni for a week to study (and feed properly). Still nice to have him back with us.
- Continued refining the PETALS paid plans, how best to provide value for money while scaling features and support fairly.
- Released the first few episodes of Managing Engineers podcast Season 2, which I’ve revived with Neil Younger, a fellow Engineering Manager at Cooperative. We’re committing to 10 episodes and wanted to record at least three episodes before releasing for peer review feedback from our close trusted circles.
- Spoke at the Tech Mids conference in Birmingham, my first appearance at a full-day event after doing evening meet-ups. Huge milestone personally and really satisfying feedback from those who attended.
- Moved [SuperRams.com](https://superrams.com) over to Substack ([derbycounty.substack.com](https://derbycounty.substack.com/)) where we could try to rebuild our old DCFC community away from the toxicity of [X.com](https://x.com). Interestingly, our Bluesky sister account continues to engage with loyal Rams.
- 6 Nov - random coffee pairing with Sandeep and Paul S from our Agile in the Ether community. Always fun to spend time chatting with more tech leaders from across the industry. Many of these folks are from government services which is completely alien to me.
- Fell off a roof ladder and seriously sprained the soft tissue in my right ankle. At first, I thought it was a broken bone but A&E assessments decided it was muscle. Either way, I was laid up in bed for a few weeks, then stuck working from home until mid December.

### **December**

- I committed to a daily video release with a PETALS Advent on the main (video) socials. This was quite an intense project but a chance to provide micro posts on all sorts of team health topics, some with a festive twist, but some quite generic. It was initially planned to be made in batches but that wasn’t always feasible. I still found quite a slick process outlining, recording, editing, releasing and promoting with the kit I have, mostly thanks to Descript and Buffer.
- We also hit the healthy milestone of House Finesse’s 300th episode which I naturally hosted with a selection of some resident request.
- I also spoke to Paul I on 20 November and Adrian H on 4 December. Big thanks to Emily Weber for keeping this community going.
