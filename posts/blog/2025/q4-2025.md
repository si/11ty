### **October**

- Chatted with university students in New York about the PETALS framework and how it has helped teams with improving psychological safety through real-world case studies (annoyingly, the recording didn’t work very well, only capturing my audio).
- Test print of Lizzie’s first book using Amazon KDP and Canva for designs. Lots of lessons learned, but quite happy with the first-ever attempt with books.
- I started using an “AddToCal” tag on my TickTick items that automatically sync with my “personal” Google Calendar. It’s been really useful to see how I spend my time and handy for looking back for posts like this.
- Had an idea: Can we feed all the House Finesse mix tracks and DJs into an LLM for easier discoverability? Not much work on this, but noted down and shared here for visibility.
- Saw The Bodyguard at Oxford’s New Theatre - birthday present for wifey. Impressive performances but as a Whitney fanboy, my expectations weren’t quite met.
- Hosted our first Lean Coffee Leaders MK at Rightmove offices, bringing together local tech leaders to share and compare similar challenges.
- Spent some time with apprenticeship students through Working Options, sharing some personal insights on working in tech for the past 30 years.
- Organised the Multipack 20th anniversary curry in Birmingham but couldn’t make it due to a clashing family birthday. We need to organise another one for Q1 that I have to attend.
- Spent a bit of time on unstyled.com - my studio name - showcasing some of the projects I’ve worked on over the past few years.
- Tried some “Hotpod yoga” on a free trial in Weedon Bec. Safe to say it’s not for me yet, way too intense and difficult for a beginner who needs some more practice in a smaller space where I can be corrected.
- Family had a week at Disneyland Paris whilst I looked after the dogs. Gave me a chance to spend some much-needed time with my best mate.
- Introduced our fourth member to the PETALS team, Sertan - someone who has also witnessed the birth and evolution of the framework, and is also super passionate about building cool stuff.
