At the start of the year, I went to Coventry University to talk about my experiences in the Web industry, touching on previous career highlights as examples. It was a fascinating opportunity to give back to the local community and, ideally, motivate the under-graduates to embrace it.

When I met [Adam Onishi](https://twitter.com/onishiweb) at [MK Geek Night](http://mkgeeknight.co.uk/), he told me about a new project he was working on and asked if I would be happy to share some thoughts on education in the Web. My initial suggestion to slate the government's "overhaul" but he was keen to avoid this tangent (sensible move considering my drunken rant).

Instead, we agreed to focus on the community aspect and how everyone gains from a few hours spent talking at local universities.
