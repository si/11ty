Going back seven years, the first tweet to direct a tweet at someone was [Robert Anderson](http://twitter.com/rsa) to [Buzz Anderson](http://twitter.com/buzz) (no relation)

> @ buzz - you broke your thumb and youre still twittering? that's some serious devotion

(Also, note the verb "twittering" - how times change)

This wasn't a recognised standard though - it was only when [Ben Darlow](https://twitter.com/kapowaz/) suggested a pseudo-text standard that would inform a user of a tweet directed at them.

[Neil Crosby](http://twitter.com/NeilCrosby) was quick to respond in an appropriate manner:

Thus, the @reply was born.

It wasn't until [May 2008](https://blog.twitter.com/2008/how-replies-work-twitter-and-how-they-might) – _18 months after the suggestion_ – that it was officially supported within the application although there was unofficial support through third party tools and services beforehand.
