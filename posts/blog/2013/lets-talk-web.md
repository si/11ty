There has recently been an influx of podcasts from leading Web professionals. Here, I list some of my personal favourites.

## [Unfinished Business](http://unfinished.bz/)

Presented by Andy "[Malarkey](http://twitter.com/Malarkey)" Clarke and [Anna Debenham](http://twitter.com/anna_debenham), this podcast focusses on the unspoken world of business. It seems to be a taboo subject in the open web community but Andy and Anna address the topic with their own experiences and in their own special way.

## [Happy Monday](http://happymondaypodcast.com/)

[Sarah Parmenter](http://twitter.com/sazzy) had a Eureka moment last year that we need to inject some inspiration and cheer into the humdrum start of the week so took it upon herself to release a short, 30 minute chat show about the web design industry. Teaming up with [Josh Long](http://twitter.com/joshlong), they introduce guests to their weekly show who all have something inspirational to contribute.

## [The Back to Front Show](http://backtofrontshow.com/)

Hosted by [Keir Whitaker](http://twitter.com/keirwhitaker) and [Kieran Masterton](http://twitter.com/kieranmasterton), this podcast takes a wider look at the Web, drawing on topical content such as conferences, emerging technology and techniques and much more. With such wisdom between the two of them, expect some insightful thoughts into the industry.

## [The Businessology Show](http://businessologyshow.biz/)

This podcast, hosted by [Dan Mall](https://twitter.com/danielmall) and [Jason Blumer](https://twitter.com/JasonMBlumer), talks about "the business of design andÂ design of business". Thankfully, both these two have tons of experience in both so you're in for a treat of interesting debate about design theory in the real world.
