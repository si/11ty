**Experimenting with different hybrid huddle models, launch Make Life Work S08, loads of TV and books recommendations and Covid finally caught Jobling Manor.**

## Work

- Completed my Engineering Manager competency review to identify key areas to focus on for rest of FY22 objectives including more coaching training and mindful of being over-empathetic/approachable
- Excellent Lunch & Learn talk by Nat about women's periods, talking about the realities of what women go through and how men can help support better
- Miro training to understand how to use it for virtual (hybrid) white boarding sessions, interesting to see all the integrations possible with popular team-based tech tools like Azure, Trello and Confluence
- Three visits to the London office over past 2 weeks
- Trained the tech podcast hosts how to setup recording equipment with Zencastr
- Started a monthly engineering huddle to share demos of recent technical deliveries, showcase different team's ways of working and recognise efforts by nominations, who win a custom mug and coaster
- Attempted a joint team strategy session in a hybrid environment but very low turnout due to Omicron cases surging around
- Ordered some custom pin badges from Sticker Mule to hand out as additional recognition (such as annual anniversaries)
- Useful workshop in the office to form a plan reviving the Tech Grad Scheme - nice to use my old Post-It's and Sharpie set for the first time in a while
- Met up with Engineering Managers from our new Northern Ireland hub for some lunch
- Blown away by Dylan's excellent Team Designer – a brand new custom app to truly understand the teams, people and skills across Tech with mixed sources of data causing confusion

## Life

- Body MOT with a hearing test (all good, just reduction on higher frequencies) and much needed podiatrist treating my neglected Hobbit trotters
- Booked a long weekend away to Munich with Mrs J, our first romantic getaway in years
- Visited Richard III’s resting place in Leicester after collecting a taxidermy duck (previously a family pet) from a local expert
- Realised I’ve been on the wrong tax code for the best part of the past tax year so overpaying now to make up for it
- Covid took over the house with the other three being struck down last week but I've managed to dodge it (so far)
