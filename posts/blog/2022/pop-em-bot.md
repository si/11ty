**This month, I had a moment of inspiration thinking about what I actually do in my role as an Engineering Manager and how much of it could possibly be automated as an EM Bot.**

With the emphasis on growing individuals, there's a lot of admin that tends to take up my time. What if a bot could satisfy these needs allowing me to be more strategic and focused on using my people skills to better effect?

These were just some initial ideas that could _technically_ be automated (third party services and API's allowing).

This would require some serious machine learning and automation, especially for any sequences dependent on complicated systems and deep neural networks, but some of the conversational "check ins" and connecting people should be quite straight forward to setup.
