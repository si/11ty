_An emotional time at work, quality family time walking and gaming and getting back into ALL the podcasts._

## Work

- Enjoyed Ryan's _#LightningTalk_ about tech-friendly objectives in [Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects)
- Started looking at Mailchimp alternatives to setup some internal newsletters ([EmailOctopus](https://emailoctopus.com/?urli=6dt2W) looks promising following Marc's recommendation)
- Great chat with Jamie & Lion about how he's experienced #neurodiversity support at work
- Celebrated some team changes and promotions with some remote Friday beers
- Our first candidate interview of the new TAG process had a great attitude but just lacked enough experience to cut it in the team
- Fascinating session reviewing the new Engineering Manager competency framework with my line manager, her often upgrading my self-assessment scores but raising interesting suggestions about neglecting areas due to too much kindness
- London trip to say goodbye to Luca (with many succumbing to positive Covid results)
- Presented a last minute "10 pro tips for engaging blog and podcast content" at _#TechDevelops_, creating slide content 2 hours before presentation
- Wellbeing Day off last Friday so went for a swim, pub lunch and vinyl hunt

## Life

- Got the new Smart ForFour put through Mercedes diagnostics but nothing came up - fun driving the courtesy A-Class for the day though
- Challenging muddy walk around Castleton in the Peak District with the family
- Struggled through home-schooling Princess following crazy number of positive Covid cases in her class
- Geeked out at Pixel Bunker in Milton Keynes, button-bashing on Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat with The Boy
- The Boy's first tae kwon do grading racked him with nerves
- Rekindled a long lost love for (NBA) basketball, now looking into (another) monthly TV subscription
- Joined the global Wordle craze with a new Ticktick habit, currently averaging a strong 4 attempts.
