Recently, it has come up a few times with friends, colleagues and [an Indiehackers thread](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/whats-your-podcasting-stack-a38b60bf1b?commentId=-N7LmS7WGHb8pPwqCVC1&utm_campaign=digest-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_source=indie-hackers-emails) about what kit I use to make podcasts so, in the interests of DRY, I thought a blog post was in order.

Naturally, tools and equipment have evolved over time so this is my setup for 2022 whilst producing [Make Life Work S09](https://makelifeworkpodcast.com/tag/season-9/), 10 years of [House Finesse](http://housefinesse.com) (not forgetting 7 years of One Phat DJ and Funky House Finesse) and the start of our [ASOS Tech Podcast](http://techpodcast.asos.com/).

Let’s get into it…

- Organise with [Cal.com](http://cal.com/jobling) - an open source equivalent to Calendly
- Record with [Zencastr](http://zencastr.com) (free solution for individual voices files) and Ableton (for mixing music)
- Kit include Samson Q2 mic, AirPods and MacBook Pro - a trusted affordable mic with my reliable Apple suite
- Produce with [Descript](https://www.descript.com/?lmref=ZzV-GA) - GarageBand has served me well but Descript provides a simpler, streamlined UX with the added benefit of automatic transcriptions (plus much more)
- Artwork with [Canva](https://www.canva.com/brand/join?token=2jhLwcJVAU36RdLPTSilgQ&referrer=team-invite) - web and iOS app for convenient (animated) graphics I can create on the move
- Hosting with [Pinecast](http://pinecast.com) - affordable hosting for as many podcasts you need with Hi-Fi addon for House Finesse audio
- Publish with [EasyWP](http://easywp.com) - all the websites use WordPress which I now host with Namecheap’s affordable hosting solution
- Promote with [Buffer](http://buffer.com) - all the socials (Instagram, Facebook and Twitter) are broadcast from a single point which can be scheduled and spread out over time to improve engagement
