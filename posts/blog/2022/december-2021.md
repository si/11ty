_Wrapping up the 2021 MonthNotes format with plenty festivities amongst family ailments, busy month with people movements at work, ramping up House Finesse efforts and identifying my audience with a content playing field._

## Life

- Tough month caring for my Gran with ongoing health problems
- Finished decorating bedrooms, now with a dark decorative wallpaper in the master room (see featured image)
- Wrote a family edition of "Night Before Christmas" as our Christmas card
- Took Princess and other Brownie friends ice skating at Whitlock
- Breakfast with Father Christmas back at Whitlock
- Got my Covid booster before the big push from Boris
- Trip to Leamington Spa for some private healthcare consultation for the Boy and a last Christmas shop (including a little vinyl indulgence with House Gospel Choir and a disco double)
- Setup an old iPhone 6 Plus for Princess’s Christmas present _#upcycle_
- Enjoyed BrewDog’s advent collection of (almost) daily beers
- Full house of family for Christmas Day with Gran, Mum and Sis (plus partners) joining
- Wiped out for 4 days over Christmas with NotCovid
- Aladdin panto back at [The Deco in Northampton](https://www.thedeco.co.uk)
- Trip to Birmingham to see old uni friends with all the kids
- Bought a Smart ForFour from Cinch to replace the unreliable Mini Coops
- Only 9 workouts (compared to November's 17) - you can tell it's December!

## Work

- Only the one office trip early on with Omicron causing concern and team absences
- Joined **Google’s DisCo** (Disability Conference) for some enlightening talks, insights and formats which I shared with our in-house Disability Network (working title)
- Started recruitment for another SSE but with revived standard TAG approach
- Workshop with PSE’s to discuss how we could revive the Tech Grad Scheme
- Self-assessed against the shiny new EM competency toolkit as a guinea pig for Gareth and Ed
- Helped interview a new EM, Jamie – my first peer interview in the role – who was successful and accepted
- Welcomed new SSE, Sertan, to the team, fast-tracking his onboarding before Christmas absences
- Finally got the rubber stamp to proceed with the tech podcast but re-baselined expectations around timelines
- Plenty engineer feedback sessions with LSE x EM x Eng tripods and 2 team Speedbacks
- Invited [Laveena](https://twitter.com/Laveena_18) along to discuss accessibility in teams at our (early) Tech Develops
- Investigated Medium analytics using their API and an internal tool to get weekly / monthly impressions & engagements from [our Tech Blog](https://medium.com/asos-techblog)
- Virtual festivities with the whole platform to have some Covid-friendly fun and downtime
- Initiated handover notes from a fellow EM who’s handing over 5 engineers in January
- Wrapped up for the year on 23rd December, downing tools for 2 weeks.

## Sides

- Fixed an overlooked HTTPS certificate issue on this blog following the EasyWP migration
- Posted a [month of #VinylAdvent on my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vinyladvent/), a mix of charity shop/eBay finds and archives from my collection
- Tested out [Exist app](https://exist.io) to compare with my [Personal Dashboard](http://sijobling.com/blog/visualise-habits-personal-dashboard/) and my **PETALS** model
- Downgraded [6 Nations KickOff](http://6nations.kickofftimes.app) to a free Heroku dyno to save unnecessary costs
- Introduced [Disco77 to the House Finesse residency](https://www.housefinesse.com/partytime)
- Invited old chum [David Dunne along for a Christmas Eve guest mix](https://www.housefinesse.com/daviddunne)
- Compiled my quarterly mix for the [annual NYE celebrations](https://www.housefinesse.com/nye21)
- Lined up 3 international recordings for [Make Life Work](http://makelifeworkpodcast.com) S08 including old [F1 Calendar](http://f1calendar.com) chum, Andy
- Worked on a [Content Playing Field](http://sijobling.com/content-playing-field/) to identify my blog (and socials) audience
