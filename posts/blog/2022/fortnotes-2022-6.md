_Calibrating energy prices, night out out in Birmingham, responsible MP’s, all the feedback for mid-years, driving recruitment, WMC mixes, record F1 traffic and the art of personal improvement._

**LIFE**

- Challenged Ovo Energy on incorrect electric estimates now we know from the new smart meter average consumption is about £35-40/week
- Saw Dylan Moran at Birmingham's Alexandria along with dinner at Comptoir Libanais and breakfast at Cosy Club
- Contacted our local MP to support a major update on NG73 guidelines for endometriosis care, got an automated response saying they don't support EDM's then a long personal message to say he would definitely follow up in parliament
- 4× runs and 2× workouts but sustained steady weight with less variation

**WORK**

- Completed 15 mid-year reviews for all my direct reports, asking a brand new question "_If you were to leave tomorrow, what would be the main reason?_" to observe any trends or actions within our remit
- Recorded another podcast episode on event driven architecture with Amrish & Sarah, Lewis and Nat
- London trip for an Orders platform huddle, 2 interviews and an EM IRL(ish) huddle to review our cross-cutting initiatives
- Piloted my PETALS feedback framework on a few engineering teams to see promising results
- Started experimenting with custom fields on Trello cards to track recruitment candidates 
- Setup an Excel document to track and visualise engineer participation on recruitment pipeline 
- Confirmed my first hire on the new process - but a long way to go finding 10 more this FY
- Refreshed a Microsoft Planner to track and visualise Tech Blog content submissions from around the tech community with all steps on the funnel
- In-house podcast production time with Lewis to share the load going forward (with a quick play on his DDJ-400's)

**SIDES**

- Mixed and released [my Spring Break '22 mix on House Finesse](https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/spring-break-22/) after reviving [Going To Miami](https://www.housefinesse.com/shows/rewind-going-to-miami/)
- Gathered some great qualitative feedback for MLW from OTS community members and [some steer from a tweet poll](https://twitter.com/MakeLifeWorkPod/status/1504718364777799704) to understand which direction to take the podcast and linked community
- Connected [@the.archive.collection](https://www.instagram.com/the.archive.collection/) Instagram to a dedicated Google Sheet which can be used for parsing later
- Andy highlighted **13.5m calendar requests in 1 week** on F1 Calendar's 2022 launch weekend
- Created an [Invite Codes page](http://sijobling.com/invite-codes/) to share referral links and promo codes of services I personally recommend
- Played around with [WP Custom Post Type UI](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/) to store personal data like weight on this blog (following Simon’s pointer)
- Dumped down some ideas for an app to help facilitate [speedback sessions](http://sijobling.com/blog/speedback/) with remote teams in Zoom (MS Teams API doesn’t currently support their breakout rooms feature)

**WATCHED**

- [Mood on BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0bn2cgw/mood) (think Fleabag with singing)
- [The Instagram Effect](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00149j7/the-instagram-effect) on BBC (scary reality of social media)
- [Schindler's List on Prime](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.1aa9f67c-efb7-fad3-0459-2f12e744dc25?ref_=dv_auth_ret&autoplay=1) (quite apt considering current affairs)
