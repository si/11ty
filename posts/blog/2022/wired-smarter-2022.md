This week, I attended the [WIRED Smarter conference](https://smarter.wired.com) at Kings Cross in London.

After adjusting to remote working through the pandemic and the continued hybrid approach, it was refreshing to get out for an in-person event, free of the typical distractions at home. I was also looking forward to some inspirational talks from industry leaders. Whilst not all topics were relevant to what I do or interested in, I often find they're the curveballs that open up imagination and new areas to consider.

I took notes throughout the day so here are my thoughts and observations across the sessions I attended.

## Common themes

- Passionate charismatic presenters who fundamentally believe in their individual topics
- Diverse variety of people from around the UK and globe, quite a few from USA
- Undertone theme seemed to be around selling their own products - with it being a commercial event directed at business leaders, it's hardly surprising
- Shorter 20-25 minute sessions encourage more succinct message but lacked detail at points

## The Impact of Web 3.0 with Tim Berners-Lee and John Bruce from [Inrupt](https://inrupt.com)

All about owning your data in Solid Pods which other services can access under your control  
Solid is not Web3 and Blockchain (as currently hyped)  
“The Web as we know it is broken”  
Consider it as "zero party data", no vendor locking  
"What's the business plan for this?" "We'll work that out later"

Overall, this feels like an early concept with ideal goals but no real world application yet.

## The Matter of Everything with Suzie Sheehy

One of the designers behind the Large Hadron Collider and 12 other experiments at CERN  
Particle physics often not recognised as fundamental in cancer treatment  
"We can _create_ serendipity"  
Most common feedback from CERN colleagues: Collaboration is key

Fascinating woman with such a wealth of knowledge and experience - [get her book](https://www.suziesheehy.com/book)!

## Innovation Across Three Dimensions with Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO

![](/img/assets/2022/10/6F94EE44-E70F-4316-B43B-4EFF7D588122.jpeg)

Think about how the customer experience is currently limited to two dimensions, how can it evolve to 3D  
References to John Lennon, 3D glasses, VR, AR and all that.  
O3DE open source engine available from Amazon

Another loose concept that’s not really made much progress when it could have.

## Squiggly Careers with Helen Tupper and Sarah Ellis

Popular podcast and book on a new way of thinking about career development  
Impressive presentation style with Sarah live sketching on iPad  
Career ladder analogy is limiting and archaic way of thinking  
Career Safari with other teams and places (aka secondments)  
Job swap should ideally be 3-9 months long

![](/img/assets/2022/10/02D2DEDC-0ADE-4F1F-9317-7F5629505555.jpeg)

Love the idea of this concept, must check out the book and podcast to think about how it can be applied personally and with my direct reports.

## Panel discussion for empowering founders

Taavet Hinrikus - Cofounder Plural, formerly Transferwise (Wise)  
Karl Lokko - Chairman, Black Seed  
Check Warner - Partner, Ada Ventures  
Omi Bell - CEO, Black Girl Ventures  
Natasha Bernell - Business editor, Wired

![](/img/assets/2022/10/F3899B9C-996E-43CB-BB72-5437325085B4.jpeg)

Shocking 0.02% VC funds go to black women entrepreneurs!  
Pandemic challenged investment. Upcoming financial crisis likely to be even worse. Rich always get richer - finance system needs addressing (Omi)  
Founders always had to be scrappy, exploring creative ways to succeed, so could stand out and flourish (Check)  
Tech giants will be laying off over coming years. What does that talent do? How do they fund efforts? Look back at last Web crash circa 2008 to learn (Taavet)  
Resilience is key through tumultuous times - entrepreneurs are best at demonstrating this (Karl)  
Mental health will be pushed through difficult times. VCs specifically provide capital and guidance to support entrepreneurs US still culturally not ready. Women's health also neglected, not just mental health. Shake the taboo systemically integrated in masculine history (Check and Omi)  
Network and community build to get started, not just seed capital but emotional and knowledge capital (Karl)  
"People fund people" (Omi)  
90% black founders are self funded (Karl)

Engaging panel with intelligent and diverse contributors highlight serious issues in startup culture.

## How The Future Works with Sheela Subramanian, VP Slack and Cofounder Future Forum

Author of How The Future Works  
"How does my job fit into my life?" not ”how does my life fit into my job?”  
Pandemic, Women leavers, YOLO economy, great resignation  
94% want flex in when they work, 79% in where

Focus Friday time - no meetings  
Only use 4 D's for meetings  
Calendar bankruptcy - clear out and rebuild every 6 month  
Async text-based whiteboard for discussions instead of physical world whiteboard and table (loudest voice wins, uninspiring environment)  
Establish principles and guardrails, set team level agreements, celebrate outcomes rather than activity  
Team level agreement refreshed on quarterly basis  
Vocal and presence != productive and valuable  
Use office to build team camaraderie  
Lead with transparency  
Stronger self of belonging

Slack (and Teams) are the future of hybrid working but don’t neglect the importance of people’s time and focus.

## The Truth About The Metaverse with Herman Narula - CEO, Improbable

Written a book about it  
"Ignore Facebook's poisonous distraction"  
Platform provides 2bn operations per second (WhatsApp only 10,000 OPS by comparison)  
M Squared is a metaverse protocol - for other vendors to adopt for distribution  
Virtual careers possible, either in the metaverse or as consultant

Blockchain and digital assets are foundation - hardware and headsets secondary

Metaverse has plenty potential but, like AR/VR, needs a killer solution to work.
