**A fortnight of COVID, much-needed weekend away in North Devon, career clarity for rest of FY22, pensions vs BTC, 5 podcast episodes released, loads of IFTTT and a new direction for football communities.**

## Work

- Dodged the office last week until family were Covid free
- Productive day in the office last Thursday testing out the shiny new podcast recording equipment followed by an EM interview in an actual room with other people in 3D
- Identified key focus areas for department (domain) wide objectives, mostly around measuring and improving team happiness and productivity (an ideal opportunity to trial my PETALS framework) 🌸
- Started looking into a Coaching Level 5 qualification with a cohort of other EM’s
- Handed over the reigns on our "emerging talent" initiative including a Tech Grad scheme revival now 3 other EM's are helping
