The great thing about habit tracking so ruthlessly with my Personal Dashboard is that I've got tons of data to rip apart for an annual review. Let's see how the year went…

## Entertainment

#### 10,438 pages in 55 books

Favourites include This Is Dyslexia, The Extinction Files and New Eden trilogies (via [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2021/54719256))

#### 59 movies watched

Don't Look Up, Back To The Future, Gladiator & Jojo Rabbit getting 5-stars (via [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/si/films/diary/for/2021/by/entry-rating/))

#### 23 vinyls in [Archive Collection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XTrjLk4hvuuPieWV3gHeAwJM_pyoQ1tlHwYsmvOYRPA/edit?usp=sharing)

Plenty dance classics from late 80s and early 90s including **14** 7" and **9** 12"

#### 477 podcasts listened

Now following [Hed Kandi](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/hed-kandi-radio/id1525350575), [Disco77](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-disco-funky-and-soulful-house-sessions/id427084084) and [Software Social](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/software-social/id1525935926)

### Entertainment Clippings

- Morning Kindle time (with a daily Ticktick habit) really encouraged me to read more often, smashing previous records, establishing a newfound love for the written word
- Saturday Pizza Night with the kids also helped us dive into some classics and new releases from the plethora of on-demand services at our disposal
- Vinyl hunting in charity shops and eBay started a new habit of logging my Archive Collection through Instagram posts (and an IFTTT recipe syncing with a Google Sheet)
- [Hacking the Apple Podcasts database](http://sijobling.com/blog/recently-played-episodes-data-from-apple-podcasts/) and getting an Apple Home Mini in the kitchen helped track the extra podcast listening time I’ve lost from remote working (aka no commute time)

## Health

#### 103 workouts over 2,924 minutes

**33%** runs, **28%** HIIT and **16%** weight training

#### Average 76.6kg

Ranging between **74.5kg** and **78.5kg**

### Health Highlights

- Hit 75km goal in January for Maggie’s Centre, raising £210 in the process
- Painful joints resulted in regular physio, custom orthotics and daily resistance band training to build up leg strength muscles
- Shifted to HIIT in March to focus on core strength
- Got 12kg dumbbells in the Summer to focus on functional strength
- Generally feeling healthier now I’m in a habit of 3-4 workouts a week
- Exercise definitely reduces around school holidays - I need to work out how to do fitness with the kids

##   
Sides

#### House Finesse

**41** releases including **16** new mixes.  
**34,906** downloads (across all shows)

#### Make Life Work

**16** new episodes over **3** seasons.  
**1,856 downloads** (across all episodes)

### Sides Show

- [Making @Fesshole with Rob Manuel](https://makelifeworkpodcast.com/fesshole-with-rob-manuel/) was the most popular MLW episode (thanks to some timely RT’s)
- [Party Time with Disco 77](https://www.housefinesse.com/finessefriday/party-time-disco77/) - his debut residency - was the biggest release day on House Finesse
- Finally got some female talent on HF with guest appearances from [Anna Cee](https://www.housefinesse.com/finessefriday/featuring-anna-cee/) and [Amy Lauren](https://www.housefinesse.com/finessefriday/featuring-amy-lauren/)
- Hooking IFTTT and Zapier up with Google Sheets opened my mind to endless life tracking/hacking on my [Personal Dashboard](http://sijobling.com/blog/visualise-habits-personal-dashboard/) over the year
- Euro 2020 motivated me to setup [footballcal.com](https://footballcal.com) based on previous [Sports Times](https://sportstimes.netlify.app) efforts but saw very little engagement
- [On The Side](http://ontheside.network) went very quiet this year with interaction severely dropping from the community - likely due to reduced capacity/motivation following the novelty of Lockdown 1 and 2.0

## Career

#### 606 Trello's completed

Since monitoring from 1 October 2021

#### 46 average weekly actions
