**2020 was the year of WeekNotes. 2021 was MonthNotes. 2022 is all about the FortNotes.**

In the interests of experimentation and finding the right balance, I’m keen to give fortnightly notes, aka _FortNotes_, a go. [WeekNotes](http://WeekNotes/) were very regular but demanding with some quiet weeks feeling pointless. MonthNotes allowed for more flexibility but got quite long and difficult to remember the detail. Fortnightly might find the right balance. (I’m also hoping Matt Asbury joins me on this venture following a brief chat about them)
