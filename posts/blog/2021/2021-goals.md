Nope, not New Years resolutions - goals. For me, resolutions are habits but goals are achievements that habits lend towards.

My goals for 2021?

1. Reduce non-work screen time 📱
2. Be more active with fitness 🏃‍♂️
3. Read another 20 books 📚
4. Make my own disco house remix 🕺
5. Host a virtual conference 🗣️

All of these are measurable and achievable plus they will give me focus when needed. Screen time and fitness are all tracked (automatically) on my Apple gear. Reading is manually tracked on Goodreads with Kindle. The final two will have actual tangible outcomes to reflect success.

I’m also setting some monthly TickTick reminders to check in on them. I might even reference them with my new “month note” format for 2021.

I’ll be using our [On The Side Slack community](http://OnTheSide.network) for support, encouragement and goal setting.

To encourage my fitness, I’ll be taking on monthly challenges raising funds and awareness for charity; [January is for Maggie’s Centre](https://www.facebook.com/donate/405365094003430/?fundraiser_source=external_url) and [March will be for Alzheimer’s Society](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/sijobling-dementia2021).

What are your goals for 2021?
