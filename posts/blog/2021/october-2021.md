_Busy month of birthdays and parties, communities of practice, hacking for sustainable fashion, concluding Make Life Work S07, another House Finesse mix compilation and celebrating Black History Month with DJ Programma guest mix and some recommended short stories._

## Work

- Started capturing a personal weekly retro, rating key factors out of 10 (e.g. productivity, stress, learning), noting top 3-5 highlights, frustrations and lessons learnt
- Went to the London office twice and Birmingham twice
- Started work on an in-house tech podcast with the first pilot hybrid recording and creating a community of practice to support
- Created mini COPs across the EM community based on joint initiatives including **Diversity, Equity & Inclusivity** (DEI), **Emerging Talent**, **Tech Brand** and **Vibe Survey Feedback**
- Co-hosted a multi-team platform day in London to discuss roadmaps and ways of working for the coming quarters
- Only the one Lightning Talk this month from Alastair on making web apps with Blaze
- Enjoyed Rudimental, Horse Meat Disco and plenty impromptu friendly chats at the big Reassembles party at Alexandra Palace
- Participated in (and won!) a "_Fashion With Integrity_" sustainability hackathon with Kim, Millie, Tia and Sashi
