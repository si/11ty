**This month saw a productive and successful month at work, plenty days out, more Apple Fitness and plenty TV shows.**

## Work

- Passed 3 month probation which highlighted how many wins I’ve already got in the role
- Hosted our first online Pub Quiz to try improve morale across multiple teams
- Arranged Euro 2020 sweepstake but got England in the “random” generator
- Some great **Lightning Talks** ⚡️ including one from Sunny about Azure Devops to GitHub
- My manager arranged a remote wine-tasting session with Kiss Of Wine - great fun… plus wine 🍷
- Four trips to London and Birmingham offices to get back in the swing of commuting plus much-needed team face-to-face time
- Last Friday was Wellbeing Day - a gift from ASOS to give all permanent staff a day’s rest. My plans for a swim were scuppered so resorted to the hot tub
- Experiments with LinkedIn post formats to engage with audiences reached a climax with 15K impressions and 500 reactions (promoting wellbeing day)

## Home

- First weekend away with Mrs J since October to Peak District - disappointing Wowcher hotel but beautiful days out to local nature
- Murder Mystery “geo-cache” tour around Birmingham with friends cut short for preferred booze
- Red flag on Green Flag cover when Mini broke down but repatriation cost double and took days (thankful for tracking with Apple Airtag though)
- The Boy wrapped up his football career with last few games for local club after nearly 10 years and impressive final performance for the entire team
- Started Apple Fitness+ subscription to try more home exercises
- Tried a couple 5K runs following 2 months of orthotics training - still causing my knees and soles grief though
- Beer festival at local Weedon Bec Roman Way brewery brought much needed sun and fun

- [On The Side Directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11NeLkuVL1Cf_FdRuS_HibwiBweO0R8CJzNpjcQl5RFU/edit) was revived thanks to reminders from Sam and Holly
- [Time Journal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AFk2PXi8s5srf1NDSOJnytMAqlWB-H4IUOx8xv8hSB0/edit) has been paused to see if it makes any difference to Get Things Done
