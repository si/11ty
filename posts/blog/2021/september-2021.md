_In a month full of birthday celebrations, charitable donations, work normality attempts, podcast-specific community, season 7 of Make Life Work, excessive life tracking, my oldest domain, vinyl classics and a new podcast playlist._

## Life

- Lunch at Bacco Lounge and crazy golf in Rugby for sister-in-law’s birthday
- Back to school for all the family with typical mix of germs causing concern
- Virtual gin tasting with disco Princess, Sophie Ellis Bextor and [Craft Gin Club](https://www.craftginclub.co.uk)
- PCR tests for both kids following COVID symptoms, thankfully both negative
- Outdoor charity cinema night at Winwick Hall watching Pirates of the Caribbean under blankets
- Impromptu dinner visit from Greek holiday chums, Donna & Maizie
- Raised £300 for Macmillan with our garden coffee morning plus good friend Hayley singing for our guests
- Garden birthday celebrations with mum and gran
- Kids started more after-school clubs with football and brownies for Princess and RAF Cadets and tae kwon do for The Boy

## Work

- One new starter and one resignation - the roundabout of line management
- First Engineering Manager Community (EMC) meet-up in London to discuss shared initiatives for FY22
- Second work “pub quiz” to break in the longer Autumn months
- _Re-Assembled_ sessions to bring staff together in London office aligned on FY22 strategy
- Looked into different pathways for senior software and QA engineers
- Failed to secure our only recruitment candidate of the month following contract offer
- Successful probation for my first recruit since returning to ASOS
- Analysis of late month’s Vibe Survey results identified fair evaluation and remote working as main concerns
- Team gathering in the office for first time since July with TWO fire alarm evacuations
- Commenced efforts with working group to create a tech podcast

- Moved MLW certificates to Cloudflare with some unexpected complications on DNS settings
- More life tracking with Trello (work), TickTick (personal), Strava (exercise and weight), Goodreads (reading) and shares metrics
- Renewed [SuperRams.com](http://SuperRams.com) for the 19th year despite zero effort to develop
- Revived sporadic “verbal diary” recordings to and from the train station when visiting the office
- Setup sijobling.com email on [iCloud+](https://www.apple.com/icloud/#plus)
