I thought I'd try a shorter "month notes" format this month, covering all the main areas but as list items. Let's see how it goes.

## Work 🏢

- Returned to the Birmingham office, the first time "in house" for 14 months - all safe but very strange experience
- Met Annette, a fellow new Engineering Manager to brainstorm some ideas
- Explored the use of Trello boards to help engineers plan and track personal development plans along with profiling tools to understand behaviours and personalities
- Recruited our first engineer headcount as a team, one of the most seamless interviews I’ve ever experienced
- Setup a fortnightly Lightning Talks ⚡️ series for our engineers to share recent learnings; first on Bitcoin, second on functional programming
- Returned to the Birmingham office to meet Tori, another new EM, for introductions IRL
- Introduced a "monthly focus" for peer (360) feedback in teams, encouraging faster-feedback and rapid personal development
- Promising feedback from the second month in the new(ish) job, thanks to vocal people responding to my feedback requested
- Recorded a Racket with [Gareth](https://racket.com/gareth) about [personal development plans](https://racket.com/si/r9f9B)
- Setup a Microsoft Power Automate process to generate permission/access emails and create development plans for newstarters

## Home 🏡

- Lovely family trip to Woburn's Centre Parcs for first bank holiday weekend including plenty outdoor activities and (uphill) cycling
- Picked up a new(ish) Mini One to get me around now lockdown is easing and travel is more likely
- Setup the novelty Apple Air Tag with the new car keys to realise precision is ruined in our thick walled house
- Obsessed over a TV show being recorded in the house (for sale) over the road
- Made the most of our local gym & pool, racking up quite a few swimming sessions and hitting a 1,500m record
- Restarted tattoo research for inspiration and local talent - now considering a record player illustration at [Revelation Northampton](https://revelationtattoos.co.uk/)
- Dad Camp returned following the COVID hiatus with lots of fire, fun & games, drinking and scorching sunshine (plus custom t-shirts from Printful)

## Sides 👷‍♂️

- Designed and built the MVP foundations of [Football Cal](http://footballcal.com) with thanks to my On The Side support and feedback
- No Multipack this month - demand seems low so now considering alternative ways of engaging
- [#FinesseFriday](https://www.housefinesse.com/finessefriday/) continued with weekly editions, culminating in a special guest mix from Paul Hutchinson
- Re-registered funkyhousefinesse.com and onephatdj.co.uk to support the audio idents from the archives
- Started plans for [Make Life Work](http://makelifeworkpodcast.com) Season 6 inviting a range of people along to talk with a new project-specific format
- Setup a Goodreads RSS syndication to my [Reading](http://sijobling.com/reading/) section
