**A month of complicated blog migrations, new iPhone 13, plenty decorations, personal training, engineer recognition, Finesse milestone, Personal Dashboard focus, revived 80s movies and dyslexic heroes.**

## Life

- Loads more decorating and DIY in the bedrooms to get ready for Christmas (thanks to local handyman help)
- Viruses doing the rounds with the Boy off school for at least a week, me off for a few days and Mrs J fighting through
- Christmas tree and lights went up mid-November to get the feels going
- Trip to Birmingham’s German market marred by The Boy randomly fainting on the train
- Princess featured in school newsletter dressed in full Children In Need outfit with her "unicorn" teacher
- Compiled a presentation of dyslexic heroes with Princess for her school class
- Swapped my iPhone 11 for iPhone 13 using Apple’s trade in and switched from Three to Vodafone - now cheaper and more reliable
- Restarted personal training in the London office gym with focus on core, stretches and toning up
- Kept a food diary in MyFitnessPal for 2 weeks to understand the nutrition balance of my average week (focus on protein rather than calories)
- **17 workouts** totalling **7 hours 53 minutes** (according to Personal Dash Strava data)

## Work

- Successfully got three engineers promoted from End Of Year reviews, my main goal in the EM role _#AchievementUnlocked_
- Another successful probation review with our latest recruit
- Resignation from one of the team’s LSE's, spurring some creative thinking around people movements
- Joined one of our WITs on their STEM Social virtual panel discussion
- Lined up [Laveena](https://twitter.com/Laveena_18) for next month's Tech Develops
- Three steps forward, two steps back on the podcast project (pilot episode, business proposal and OKR shared, still pending feedback and agreement to continue)
- Presented a **PETALS** framework for measuring morale (blog post pending)
- Prototyped objectives in GitHub projects alongside our new inner-sourced competency framework with Ryan

## Sides

- Outlined a high level roadmap for the next 12 months based on primary personal goals in Confluence (to be published in 2022)
- Recorded guest podcast with Matt Asbury from [Gymshark](http://gymshark.com) on Leadership in Engineering
- Started booking in (relatively successful) _international_ guests for [Make Life Work](http://makelifeworkpodcast.com) S08
- Impressive weekly downloads on House Finesse thanks to two guest DJ’s, [Disco77](https://www.housefinesse.com/finessefriday/featuring-disco77/) (our 100th episode) and [Black Dynamite](https://www.housefinesse.com/finessefriday/featuring-black-dynamite/)
- Subtle growth in engagement with our [On The Side community](http://ontheside.network) following the October slump
- Loads of updates and improvements in my Personal Dashboard (inc tech/entertainment Monzo split, Twitter metrics and Untapped feed parsing), along with a (prolonged) [blog post explaining my process](http://sijobling.com/blog/visualise-habits-personal-dashboard/)
- Several failed attempts to migrate my blog from Linode ($120/yr and difficult to maintain) to EasyWP (£30/yr and managed)
- Recognised [15 years on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Si/status/1457605078328750081)
- Let jobl.in go (again!)
