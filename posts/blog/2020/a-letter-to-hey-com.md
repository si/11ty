A new email service has popped up from the people behind Basecamp called Hey.com. To join the service, you are asked to write an email on what you love (or hate) about email. This is what I wrote:

> The internet connected people. It created a place for everyone to share stories, facts, useful information for others to find and enjoy. Email gave people another way to talk. It allowed us to think about what to say but receive it immediately. And at no cost. This is what I miss from the early times of the Internet. It was simpler and safer to enjoy. This is why I wanted in. 
> 
> _Subject_: I miss simpler times

If I get in, I'll update this post.
