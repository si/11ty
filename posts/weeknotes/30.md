<p><em>Week 30 of 2020 brings my first week off since Christmas, offline time in Rhodes, sci-fi books, loads of podcasts, the joy of magazines, swimming nearly 10km, Mindnodes and Leader Readme's.</em></p>

<ul><li>Time off from work – no computer, tablet or TV</li><li>Instead, it was time <em>offline</em> with Kindle, podcasts and magazines</li><li>We apprehensively booked a last minute flight to a friend's hotel in Rhodes with flight restrictions lifted this week. </li><li>Flying through the lockdown was strange; Birmingham Airport was a ghost-town compared to the first Saturday of Summer Holidays every other year. The flight was at a hugely reduced capacity too – whether it was intentional or not – but certainly eased any concerns, even with face masks on permanently.</li><li>I read some sci-fi for the first time in <em>ages</em> and enjoyed it more than I expected; finished <a href="https://amzn.to/2CTgJT3">Aftershock by Marko Kloos</a> (fantasy multi-planet thriller) and started reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3hDrRlN">The Man Of Legends by Kenneth Johnson</a> (another curious thriller, this time with some funky time-travelling happening)</li><li>Caught up on my podcast cue in Overcast; <a href="https://www.relay.fm/adapt">Adapt</a> (on the reality of working solely on an iPad), <a href="https://fellow.app/supermanagers/">Super Managers</a> (on meeting formats and leadership), <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/podcasts">Wired</a> (general news and science, obviously very COVID-focused), <a href="https://defected.com/music/radio">Defected</a> (I need <em>some</em> tunes whilst I'm chilling), <a href="https://www.offmenupodcast.co.uk/">Off Menu</a> (and a giggle) and <a href="https://lockdownparent.podbean.com/">Lockdown Parenting</a> (plus a bit topical humour) </li><li>Enjoyed flicking through some paper-based mags; Total Film to catch up on the year's (delayed) movie releases and T3 to perv over some luxurious tech.</li><li>Swimming. <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/2525944#graph_date_range?chart_type=miles&amp;interval_type=week&amp;interval=202030&amp;year_offset=0">Lots of swimming</a>. And, according to Apple Watch, more daily fitness than when I'm working during lockdown.</li><li>In-between relaxation, I started using <a href="https://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> on my iPhone, creating mindmaps for iPad setup, Mac setup, <a href="http://ontheside.network">On The Side</a>, <a href="http://makelife.work">Make Life Work</a>, travel history (following a chat with the family) and any thoughts about work.</li><li>On the flight back, after listening to <a href="https://fellow.app/supermanagers/the-art-of-leadership-with-michael-lopp-rands-in-repose/">Michael Lopp on Super Managers</a>, I started thinking about writing a <em>Leader Readme</em> (like my <a href="https://github.com/si/readme">Manager Readme</a> but with preferred semantics and shift in career focus). I started outlining my thoughts and will return to it next week.</li></ul>
