Loads of detail about metaverses, blockchain, cryptocurrency and NFT and quite up to date (referencing Facebook rebrand to Meta) but lacked the counter arguments such as health, social and technical implications. It desperately needs proof reading too - loads of grammatical and formatting errors on the Kindle edition (even some Mailchimp Javascript and CSS was embedded).
