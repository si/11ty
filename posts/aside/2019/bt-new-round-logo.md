I salute the confidence of such a bold move (maybe that's why it took them so long to get it live - months or even years of design by committee to sign off?) but, even as a fan of round monochrome identities, I can't say I'm that impressed.

I know plenty work normally goes in to rebrands – especially at the scale of an organisation like BT – but this is quite a remarkable simplification of what could've been a significantly influential step in British design culture.

It does look particularly similar to a well-known fashion company I'm close to as well…
