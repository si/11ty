[Over Instagram](https://overinstagram.com/) is a project to give photographers a place to hone their craft, avoiding the "toxic treadmill of insecurity and self-doubt" with social media, focusing on the important factors such as tone, balance and composition.

Follow along as the project is built in the open, even get involved if you're keen to shape it.
