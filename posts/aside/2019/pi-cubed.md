I love all the layers of Pi on this record-breaking feat:

> Googler Emma Haruka Iwao has been busy using Google Compute Engine, powered by Google Cloud, to calculate the most accurate value of pi—ever. That’s 31,415,926,535,897 digits, to be exact. Emma used the power of the cloud for the task, making this the first time the cloud has been used for a pi calculation of this magnitude.

She calculated Pi to the precision of Pi (ish) on Pi Day (14th March - works better for our Stateside friends).
