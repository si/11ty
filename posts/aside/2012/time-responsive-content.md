Adrian Short ([@adrianshort](https://twitter.com/adrianshort))Â [suggests how council websites should consider time](http://blog.adrianshort.co.uk/2012/07/14/its-time-to-make-council-websites-more-timely/)Â as part of a responsive strategy but this could apply to many other industries.

Think about context; with device, location and time of day, the content could intelligently respond to the user with much more appropriate information.

If you know I'm located near a swimming pool in the morning, you could tell me what sessions are currently on. If I'm at home at the weekend, tell me what local events are on. If I'm in an industrial park in the day time, tell me the local bus routes and times.

As the saying goes - content context is key.
