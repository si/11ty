Love the sentiment behind [Just Build Websites](http://justbuildwebsites.com/) "“ a simple campaign from the folks behind [Front End Design Conf](http://frontenddesignconference.com/), inspired by a question from Chris Coyier's [Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/).

It echoes many thoughts from my recent article for .net mag, [No More Excuses](http://sijobling.com/aside/design-excuses-how-to-beat-them/). If you're not sure what new topic to learn in web design, just make a website and the technology will follow. Don't try to build something to fit a technique "“ use a technique to fit a need.
