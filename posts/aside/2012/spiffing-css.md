If you speak "The Queen's" English (otherwise known as British), you can typeÂ proper spellings of syntax such as _colour_, _centre_ and _transparency_ then apply theÂ [Spiffing CSS](http://spiffingcss.com/)Â pre-processor to convert back to a language browsers understand.

Silly but brilliant. Bravo,Â [Visual Idiot](http://visualidiot.com/).
