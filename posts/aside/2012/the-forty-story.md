My thoughts along with [Sarah Parmenter](http://sazzy.co.uk/) and [Steven Bonner](http://stevenbonner.com/) on Pentigram's clever approach to their 40 year celebratory showreel "The Forty Story".

> With such a diverse and impressive range of clients through the years, the Forty Story is a brilliant approach to create an emotional connection between them all. The images speak volume but the accompanying dialogue and soundtrack set a great tone to the showreel, emphasising the bond Pentagon have built up with their customers and portfolio. Itâ€™s a lovely idea well executed.

See what Sarah and Steven both have to say on [Is this the best showreel ever made?](http://www.creativebloq.com/inspiration/is-this-the-best-showreel-ever-made-1233993/).
