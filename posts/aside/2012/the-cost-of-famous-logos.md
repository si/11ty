[![](/img/assets/2012/08/coca-cola.png "Coca-Cola")](http://stocklogos.com/topic/famous-logo-designs-and-how-much-did-they-cost)

Stock Logos compiled some [famous logos along with their respective costs](http://stocklogos.com/topic/famous-logo-designs-and-how-much-did-they-cost).

Ranging from Coca-Cola's free logotype to BP's $211m flower rebrand, it's quite remarkable to compare the difference between the time periods and industries.

I never realised the Twitter bird was originally designed by British designer, [Simon Oxley](http://dribbble.com/simonox) at the ridiculously low cost of $15.
