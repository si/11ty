I like this idea of introducing dedicated symbols for crediting content; [↬](http://www.curatorscode.org) for "via" and [↩](http://www.curatorscode.org) for "hat tip".

With a growing online culture of journalism through blogging, Twitter and beyond, a simplified approach to attributing appropriate sources could help minimise lazy journalism where it is too easy to plagiarise content.

I appreciate this is unlikely in a competitive world where content = impressions = monetisation but, for the more ethical, open-source online community, standardisation is certainly welcome.

I would love to see more content providers to introduce these symbols to their material or designs. It's only with widespread adoption that such suggestions become standards (remember, the now familiar _#hashtags_ and "[slash tags](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/11/08/slashtags/)" both came from repetitive use of [community suggestions](https://twitter.com/#!/factoryjoe/statuses/223115412)).
