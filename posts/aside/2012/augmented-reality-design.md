This week'sÂ Industry Insight by Creative Bloq focussed on Google's patent for augmented reality glasses and what it could mean to design.

They asked me for my thoughts on the topic where I think about data, APIs and web applications:

> â€œThe concept of augmented reality has plenty of potential when it comes to design.
> 
> It brings all the information of the Internet to a relevant contextual situation so we have to think about the organisation and availability of data. If youâ€™re creating a web app or service, is the information available through APIs? Can your data improve someoneâ€™s experience in an appropriate manner?
> 
> We laughed at the vision scenes of the Terminator, evaluating his environment in real time, but all this becomes a possibility with a Web of data accessible from a pair of glasses â€“ or, maybe in the not-so-distant-future, contact lenses.â€
