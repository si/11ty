[Wikipedia Redefined](http://www.wikipediaredefined.com/)Â is an interesting redux of Wikipedia by Lithuanian agency,Â [New Is New](http://newisnew.lt/en).

They took two Spring months to re-imagine Jimmy Wales' popular website with regards to design, usability and focus.

Whilst the proposed rebrand could cause confusion with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)' "W" logotype, the suggested improvements to the homepage make a lot of sense. The key search functionality is lost among all the supported languages and translations so shifting emphasis could vastly improve usability. I also like the colour coded languages and cross promotion of other Wikimedia properties.

Projects like this always fascinate me. It's an ideal opportunity for any designer to flex their muscles on an existing user experience, find (minor) faults and consider improvements. Often, these exercises put your own projects in a different light so the time and resources spent are not wasted.
