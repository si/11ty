Earlier in the year, .net magazine published a thought piece I wrote about [no more excuses](http://sijobling.com/portfolio/no-more-excuses/) that typically kill motivation.

The article went down quite well with a number of promising reviews from friends and peers – even exposure on the magazine cover – which motivated me to pursue further writing.

Today, the article has been republished on their website: [Design Excuses and How To Beat Them](http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/design-excuses-and-how-beat-them). May I suggest you head over and read it if you missed the original article - or even glance over it again for a refresh.

I'd love to hear your thoughts too. [Tweet me](http://twitter.com/Si) (@Si) other common excuses you've experienced and how to combat them.
