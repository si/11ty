John Allsop has created a beautifully executed [timeline of the Web](http://webdirections.org/history/).

The user-friendly experience highlights key points from the past going right back to some initial thought leaders such as Jorge Luis Borges short story from 1941 "The Garden of Forking Paths", regarded as the original conception of hypertext.

It's a work in progress but sets a fantastic primer for anyone interested in the foundations of our Internet.
