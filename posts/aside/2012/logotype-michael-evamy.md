[Michael Evamy](http://twitter.com/michaelevamy) has published a thoroughly insightful investigation into the art of logotypes.

If you were after a brief overview of the topic, this book is not for you. It's an epic encyclopaedic journey through the history of logotypes, bringing together thousands of brands and identities into one comprehensive behemoth.

As an avid typo-phile myself, I could spend hours, if not days, browsing through the collection, seeking inspiration for my next design.
