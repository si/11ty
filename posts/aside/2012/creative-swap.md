[Creative Swap](http://www.creativeswap.co/)Â looks like an interesting initiative to inspire creativity between agencies by swapping talent for a week.

Setup by London agency [Sane & Able](http://saneandable.co.uk/), the event intends to break down typical barriers between agencies, sharing skills and learning from others, possibly completely different disciplines. Each placement will picked at random and is available for free to all.

This is a really exciting project demonstrating the open-ness of the creative industry and how we can learn from each other. During these tough economic times, it's easy to neglect training within our demanding industry.

However, by allocating just a week of time to learn new principles and methods, the investment can quickly pay off with the new techniques learned and networking with other like-minded people.
