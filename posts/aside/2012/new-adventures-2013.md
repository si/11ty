The amazingÂ [New Adventures In Web Design conference](http://2013.newadventuresconf.com/) returns to Nottingham for 2013.

Having attended the first event last year, I was hugely impressed. Rather than focus on proven techniques, the stage is set to discuss potential new ideas for the Web, a much more inspirational approach to web conferences. Kudos to Colly and Greg on forming such an enthralling event.

Unfortunately I missed this year's sequel due to new baby commitments but I hope to get my act together for what is bound to be a phenomenal third (and possibly final) chronicle of New Adventures.
