Whilst watching kids TV with my wife, we were discussing the design components of [Bottle Top Bill](http://www.bottletopbilltv.com/) - a unique edutainment programme intended to inspire imagination and creativity at a young level. We weren't entirely sure if the household elements used to create the characters were photographs or digitally created.

I decided to do some research and ended up asking the original creator, [Cameron Chittock](http://www.cameronchittock.com/), about the design process:

> You are both right!
> 
> I made some models and photographed them 24 times on a turn table. Then made a puppet using planes in 3D Studio Max and animated the photos as textures Max (Material) or Maya (Shader).
> 
> The arms and legs are true 3D components.
> 
> This idea is commonly used, just not in such a sophisticated way.
