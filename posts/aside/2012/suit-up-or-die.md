[The first edition](http://magazine1.suitupordie.com/) of [Suit Up or Die](http://www.suitupordie.com/)Â - an online magazine for male fashion -Â takes an innovative approach to it's design with an elegant user experience utilising the "off canvas" design patternÂ ([coined by LukeÂ Wroblewski](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514))Â with bold photography, typography and grid systems.

I love the direction this has taken. It's a fantastic use of modern technology and will be interesting to see what uptake will be like on tablets or mobile devices.
