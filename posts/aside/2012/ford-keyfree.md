It's not often I throw around the term "game changer" but this could be one of them…

One of the most unlikely candidates, Ford (yep, as in the car manufacturer) have created a secure password system for websites using Near Field Communication (NFC) and BlueTooth called Ford Keyfree.

By installing the iOS app and Chrome extension, you can automatically login to popular websites such as Gmail and Facebook just by being in the vicinity of your desktop.

I've not been able to try this out (the [French landing page](http://www.ford.fr/keyfreelogin) is currently offline) but the [Vimeo video](http://vimeo.com/43886541) explains it well.
