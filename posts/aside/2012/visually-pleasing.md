[Visual.ly](http://visual.ly/) â€“ a fantastic startup giving people the tools to create data visualisations â€“ has just launched a redesigned site.

The user experience has been thoroughly thought out on this revision, simplifying the main navigation, reorganising homepage content with a stronger focus on the end product and easier discovery of existing content such as the popular topics (with lovely iconography) and elegant filter tools.

To see household names like [Moneysupermarket](http://visual.ly/users/moneysupermarket) using the tools to present [intriguing information](http://visual.ly/value-dad) from their vast data is reassuring.
