[![](images/Contact-Us-Joint-London.png "Contact Us - Joint London")](http://www.jointlondon.com/)

[Joint London](http://www.jointlondon.com/)Â have created an innovative user experience for their website drawing on the standard "Contact Us" section of websites.

Rather than just present some standard contact details, they've built their profile around the word "Us", extending into more depth of each founder with biographies and social connections.

What I found particularly interesting is how the user returns to previous sections where they replace the current breadcrumb with the "Back" action. It's not obvious at first but by the process of discovery, it quickly becomes apparent.

The Contact section is quite amusing where they portray the idea of international offices in New York, Shanghai and Sao Paolo yet the only active site is in London. Nothing wrong with setting goals.
