[Web Expo Guildford](http://webexpoguildford.co.uk/) is a dual track conference hosted in London's Guildford by local agency, [Kyan](http://kyan.com/).

The line-up looks impressive with some reputable figures from the Web scene, the "grassroots" price is extremely reasonable and I'm loving the clean, muted design of the website.

Definitely a conference worth considering "“ but don't take too long.
