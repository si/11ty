[Brad Frost](http://twitter.com/brad_frost) has started a [Responsive Web Design Newsletter](http://bradfrostweb.com/responsive-web-design-newsletter/) in an attempt to compile useful resources on the heavily recommended technique into a regular email.

The [first edition](http://eepurl.com/mS3cv) includes sections on layout, navigation, typography, process, the ongoing debate over images, testing and some snazzy samples for inspiration.

Whether you're new to RWD or keen to keep an eye on emerging techniques, I suggest you sign up.

(I've been thinking of setting up something similar recently, not specifically on responsive web design but the Web as a whole. I realise it's nothing new but it's a new twist on my noisy stream of link tweets that many follow me for. If you think it's a good idea, [tweet me](http://twitter.com/Si).)
