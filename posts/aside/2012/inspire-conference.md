[Inspire Conference](http://2012.inspireconf.com/) in Leiden, Netherlands has recently been announced and what a line-up: with thought leaders like Jeffrey Zeldman, Chris Shiflett and Brad Frost at the helm, this is one not to be missed.

It all happens over 4 days, 9-12th December 2012, just in time for that picturesque trip on the run up to Christmas.
