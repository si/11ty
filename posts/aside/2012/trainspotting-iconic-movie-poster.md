[![Trainspotting movie poster](/img/assets/2012/07/trainspotting.png "Trainspotting movie poster")](http://2017.sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/trainspotting.png)Creative Bloq recently asked for my design opinion of an iconic movie poster, of which I selected the cult British movie, Trainspotting:

> Arguably, this is one of Britain's most iconic movie posters of all time. The distinctive style set of the white/orange lower-case Helvetica, under grayscale photography of the main cast, captured the tone of the movie perfectly: dark, moody characters encapsulated in the vibrant, young drugs scene of the nineties. Definitely one of my favourites.
