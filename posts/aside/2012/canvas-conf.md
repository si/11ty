[Canvas](http://2012.canvasconf.co.uk/)Â â€“ the first proper web development conference in Birmingham by the guys at [383 Project](http://383project.com).

The single day event on 7th September 2012 is bringing together some heavyweight names from the Web development scene including [James Whittaker](https://twitter.com/jmwhittaker/ "@jmwhittaker on Twitter") from Twitter, [Chris Mills](http://twitter.com/chrisdavidmills "@chrisdavidmills on Twitter") from Opera and [Harry Roberts](http://twitter.com/csswizardry/ "@csswizardry on Twitter") from BSkyB to talk about building the next generation of websites.

Considering it's (arguably) England's Second City, Birmingham has struggled to take off in the web community. I originally co-found [The Multipack](http://multipack.co.uk) in an attempt to bring local talent together but there have been no major conferences to speak of that have helped push the region forward.

I, for one, really hope Canvas changes that.
