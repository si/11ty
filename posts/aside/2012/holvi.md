[Holvi](https://holvi.com/#tour) looks like an innovative approach to banking, more geared towards teamwork and collaboration in startups.

Based in Finland, the service offers a full accounting solution like any other online bank, giving you the functionality to set budgets, pay bills and accept payments all through the one account. You can even manage an online store through your account as well as issue invoices.

Accounts are free although charges are applied to transactions to subsidise the costs. The design is slick and the user experience has definitely been honed to modern online (startup) requirements.

Definitely one to watch.
