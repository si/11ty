Over three years old and it's still invaluable "“ Andy Clarke's [Contract Killer: The Next Hit](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/contract_killer_the_next_hit) makes sure you cover your arse when working with any client on a Web project.

It's kindly published under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-a-Like license so free for your use with a little credit back. Also worth nothing Andy is by no-means a lawyer (but does fancy himself as a [top detective](http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/)) so make sure you get legal advice if you want to be 100% sure.
