The user experience that epitomised Minority Report is now available in a $70 box.

The guys at [Leap Motion](http://www.leapmotion.com/) have created a device that allows user interactions without any typical input devices. The video demonstration shows so much potential with the use cases, from design to gaming, maps to data analysis.

This could seriously revolutionise how we interact with computers in the near future.
