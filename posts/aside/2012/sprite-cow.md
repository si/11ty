[Sprite Cow](http://www.spritecow.com/) is a really smart web app for generating the necessary CSS for sprite sheets.

With it's intuitive user interface, you simply load your sprite sheet and select the elements to get the background offset position, width and height. It even supports 2x Retina displays and bespoke background colours.

Extremely handy for quickly creating CSS for your website.
