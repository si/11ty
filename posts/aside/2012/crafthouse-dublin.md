[Crafthouse · Dublin](http://crafthou.se/) is another exciting new social venture by the charming [Doc Parsons](http://twitter.com/drbparsons) and crew intending to bring together the local web community for regular meet-ups with organised talks.

The design and branding is excellently executed and, with such intelligent enthusiasm behind the scenes, I expect big things from these guys.
