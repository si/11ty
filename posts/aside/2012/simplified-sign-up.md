Mark Collins suggests how to make[Â a far better sign-up form](http://pixxel.co/feed/a-better-sign-up-form)Â for your website.

By reducing the number of required fields such as email and password confirmation â€“ even usernames â€“ the user experience is vastly improved and, consequently, should improve conversions.

Mark uses Twitter as a shining example of these principles. With such a huge audience and user base, they have the statistics to make informed design decisions around these suggestions.

Think about your users, not your personal objectives. Once someone has registered for a website, they can improve their experience with additional data at a later date should they desire.
