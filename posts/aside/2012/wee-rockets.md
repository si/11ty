[Wee Rockets](http://weerockets.com/)Â is a lovely new iPad game designed and created by Paddy Donnelly ([@paddydonnelly](http://twitter.com/paddydonnelly)) and Alain Hufkens ([@hufkens](http://twitter.com/hufkens)).

The concept is simple: kids build their own rockets, launch them into space and race through asteroids to rescue aliens.

The design is sublime, drawing(!) on Paddy's marvellous illustration skills and the game mechanics work really well. It's the attention to detail that really shows.
