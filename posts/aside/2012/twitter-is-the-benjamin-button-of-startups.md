Google engineer,Â Andrey Petrov eloquantly epitomisesÂ [Twitter as the Benjamin Button of startups](https://plus.google.com/109834643338395014064/posts/A9Fk7bsCA1B).

> Born out of wisdom and insight in our daily social behaviour, completely changing the way we communicate. Soon grown into a heroic Atlas, holding up the world of third-party developers on its shoulders, thriving as the platform rises along with thousands of apps and services transforming the experience. Dusk approaches when Twitter sheds its desire to leave a mark on humanity and finds itself destined to die as a single-feature web-based MVP. A sparkle in a developer's eye.

Having witnessed the entire journey of Twitter's lifespan to date, Andrey's summary really hits home for me. I've long been a fan of Twitter, from it's humble beginnings to the revolutionary approach to global communication. I hate to see them shoe-horn a business model into the established protocol but it was inevitable after many rounds of investment.

Maybe they can pull off a howler by satisfying the many disgruntled geeks but it's looking more and more unlikely as the months pass. Time will tell.
