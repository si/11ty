[![](images/doodads.jpeg "Crayola Doodads")](http://2017.sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/doodads.jpeg)Daniel Mall takes us through another insightful design process, this time on how he and the [Big Spaceship](http://www.bigspaceship.com/)Â team [redesigned theÂ CrayolaÂ website](http://danielmall.com/work/crayola/).

What struck me about this one is how they considered the target audience, specifically around organising the masses of existing content. The inclusion of real children's "doodads" is a lovely touch too.

All in all, the team did an amazing job that all designers could learn from.
