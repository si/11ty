Social startup Buffer started an interesting experiment on Tuesday â€“Â [What one thing would you tell your younger self?](http://blog.bufferapp.com/a-grand-experiment-what-one-thing-would-you-tell-your-younger-self)

They registered the Twitter account [@aYoungerMe](http://twitter.com/ayoungerme) which was plugged in to the Email to Buffer service. When anyone sends an email to [ayoungerme@to.bufferapp.com](mailto:ayoungerme@to.bufferapp.com), the subject is automatically added to the hourly Buffer queue for Twitter.

It's a wonderful idea which has already uncovered some reassuring results with a number of tweets getting [retweeted and favourited](http://favstar.fm/users/AYoungerMe).
