[Project Re:Brief](http://www.projectrebrief.com/)Â is an interesting concept from Google, considering how some of America's most iconic advertising campaigns could be repurposed for the web, especially with the growing mobile audience and responsive web movement.

With such powerful brands like Coca-Cola, Volva and Avis as case studies, it could be quite interesting to see how this pans out.
