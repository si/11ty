This week, Creative Bloq's Industry Insight asked leading designers what they thought of Facebook's recent IPO and the design challenges they face as a consequence:

> â€œFacebook has quite a challenge now to ensure it continues to deliver a user-focussed design.
> 
> â€œItâ€™s all well and good putting a 12-figure value on the product, bringing investment to the business, but Facebookâ€™s key product continues to be their millions of users and how they fulfil the usersâ€™ desires.
> 
> â€œThey need to innovate, introduce engaging new ways for visitors to stay on the site, consuming valuable products for both parties. Itâ€™ll be interesting to see how the platform evolves over the next 12 months.â€
