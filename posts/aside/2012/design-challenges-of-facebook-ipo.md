This week, Creative Bloq's Industry Insight asked leading designers what they thought of Facebook's recent IPO and the design challenges they face as a consequence:

> "Facebook has quite a challenge now to ensure it continues to deliver a user-focussed design.
> 
> "It's all well and good putting a 12-figure value on the product, bringing investment to the business, but Facebook's key product continues to be their millions of users and how they fulfil the users' desires.
> 
> "They need to innovate, introduce engaging new ways for visitors to stay on the site, consuming valuable products for both parties. It'll be interesting to see how the platform evolves over the next 12 months."
