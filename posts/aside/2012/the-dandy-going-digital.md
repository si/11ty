I've returned to my old ways, contributing where I can to Creative Bloq's Industry Insight. This week, the focus is on The Dandy's move to digital and the future of digital comicsâ€¦

> As a child, I always leaned towards The Beano rather than The Dandy (it's funny how early you start brand loyalties). Every week, I was waiting for the Thursday release so I could go spend 20p on my favourite comic. It's funny how times change...
> 
> In a world of instant demands, the shift towards digital delivery comes as no surprise. Kids now expect instant media: digital photographs on their mobile, music straight on their iPod. Expecting comics on their tablet seems only natural.
> 
> It's a shame the age old tradition of dead-tree comics are phasing out but, equally, reassuring that these established business models are moving with the times, harnessing technology and user trends."
