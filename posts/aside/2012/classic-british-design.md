This week, Creative Bloq got in a typically British mood to celebrate Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee weekend by asking a number of designers of their favourite British design classic:

> â€œFor me, the original Mini is a classic British design.
> 
> â€œThe under-stated appearance with oozes of character perfectly encapsulate everything that is British. It doesnâ€™t carry any particular status around it â€“ the product is accessible to all demographics â€“ but, equally, it still holds that authority as a pillar of society â€“ especially in itâ€™s traditional red body with the Union Jack roof on this Diamond Jubilee weekend.â€
