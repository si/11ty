This week, Creative Bloq got in a typically British mood to celebrate Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee weekend by asking a number of designers of their favourite British design classic:

> "For me, the original Mini is a classic British design.
> 
> "The under-stated appearance with oozes of character perfectly encapsulate everything that is British. It doesn't carry any particular status around it "“ the product is accessible to all demographics "“ but, equally, it still holds that authority as a pillar of society "“ especially in it's traditional red body with the Union Jack roof on this Diamond Jubilee weekend."
