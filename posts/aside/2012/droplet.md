[Droplet](https://dropletpay.com/)Â is an interesting concept for sending payments to friends or businesses with your mobile.

Currently being tested in it's home town, Birmingham with 30 merchants and over 1,000 people, users "top up" their account with a debit card then send payments to friends, shops, restaurants or bars with the mobile app.

Lovely work from the guys at Supercool Design too on [creating the identity](http://www.supercooldesign.co.uk/news/d-is-for)Â â€“ it's simple but extremely effective.

Being an advocate for Birmingham-based startups, I really want to see this succeed. The plan to trial the concept in close proximity makes a lot of sense whilst fine-tuning the product but, hopefully, it won't take long to get (inter)national support and exposure.
