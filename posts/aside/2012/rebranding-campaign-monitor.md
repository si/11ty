Email marketing provider, [Campaign Monitor,](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/) have recently launched a redesigned website along with a snazzy new branding.

As part of the [design process of the rebrand](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3759/rethinking-our-branding), they took a lot into consideration including the personality of the company, target audience and contextual placement.

I always find articles discussing the design process fascinating, especially when it's regarding a company I've long admired.
