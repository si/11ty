[Derek Powazek questions whether social networks are actually profitable](http://powazek.com/posts/3024)Â with some enlightening facts to support his arguments.

He takes into consideration Digg's recent sale value of (alleged)Â $500k compared to it's initial investment of $45m, Facebook's IPO woes plus the troubles Twitter and Tumblr are having shoe-horning a business model into their hugely popular services without upsetting users.

These trends suggest monetisation of social networks are a red herring; it goes against the grain of what make people interact on a social level. Humans are extremelyÂ perceptibleÂ to free stuff, less so towards paid products without a tangible result.

Derek also makes reference to MaciejÂ Ceglowski who setup [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/) on the backlash of Yahoo's rumoured plans to close Delicious and how he foundÂ [moderate success with his paid service](http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/). This shows transparency and honestyÂ with your customers from the start can go a long way.

The debate has raised some interesting thoughts that are going around the community at present. I'm definitely intrigued where it is all going.
