[Sun](http://pattern.dk/sun/) is a stunning mobile web app by [Jakob Henner](http://twitter.com/jalifax) for checking the weather in any global location.

It utilises Adam Whitcroft's beautiful [Climacons icon set](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/), mashed up with [Google's (unofficial) Weather API](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/02/08/googles-secret-weather-api/) and [Yahoo! PlaceFinder API](http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/placefinder/) to create an elegant pinch-to-zoom user experience.

This is a perfect example of what can be created from open-sourced content. I love the retro feel of the design but the pinch menu UI is inspirational. No doubt others will "borrow" that effect.
