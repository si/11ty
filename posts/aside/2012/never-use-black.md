Ian Storm Taylor reminds designers why they should [never use black](http://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/).

He reflects on old art classes when his teacher demonstrates excellent use of colour in shadows with rare application of true black. He also considers the aesthetics of digital application where software uses dark tones of grey instead for a more realistic feel.

It's a healthy reminder of the importance when using colour in design. I've recently moved away from applying full black (this site is a perfect example in the text and logotype). It certainly makes a difference to the end result.
