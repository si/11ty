[![Ubuntu for phones](/img/assets/2013/01/phone-photo-hero.jpg)](http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone)

Not content with servers and desktop, Ubuntu is now available in your pocket with [Ubuntu for phones](http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone).

They're not the first open source framework to venture into the mobile OS realm â€“ [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/)Â have already made their contributions.

The user experience has certainly lent inspiration from the more popular OS (namely iOS and Android) but that's the one advantage to playing catch up - identifying the qualities and flaws then building on them.

I'd like to see operators and OEMs get this on devices quickly to fight as a viable contender in the mobile market. The more competition, the better options and experiences for customers.

Hats off to Inayaili LeÃ³n and the rest of the Canonical team on [the lovely page design](http://design.canonical.com/2013/01/designing-the-new-ubuntu-for-phone-pages/) too. Clean, uncluttered and organised.
