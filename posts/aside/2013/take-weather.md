[Take Weather](http://www.takeweather.com/) is a nice twist on the "traditional" weather app, offering users the ability to share weather photographs in a social network.

What particularly caught my attention was the lovely UI design. Adopting my preferred "flat aesthetic", the simple use of monochrome icons and typography really work well.
