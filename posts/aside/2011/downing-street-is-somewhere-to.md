As part of a new initiative from [Somewhere To](http://www.somewhereto.com/number10) â€“ a collaborative projectÂ between Livity, Legacy Trust UK and Channel 4 to find space for youths to express themselves â€“ Downing Street offered a selection of passionate youngsters the chance to use the building for free-running, perform speaking word and practice boxing.
