I've been keeping a close eye on US banking startup [Simple](http://www.simple.com/), specifically as I'm interested in their revolutionary new approach to a stale business model.

  

Only time will tell whether the startup will succeed and whether it will make it across The Pond but, until then, the thought process behind their recent rebrand is an insightful read.
