The team at [Hed Kandi](http://www.hedkandi.com/) - one of my favourite house music labels - have released a sample pack of their flagship disco sounds for artists and producers to create their own dance material. There's no denying the distinctive sound of Hed Kandi has established a position in the genre so this is a welcome arrival to any musician's arsenal.

I've been planning to get into production at some point so this might push me in the right direction.
