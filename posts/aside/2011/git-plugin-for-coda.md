I've long been a fan of [Panic's Coda](http://www.panic.com/coda/), one of the simplest and most intuitive code editors I've found for the Mac, but lack of Git integration has held me back from switching to the recommended version control technology.

Thanks to Justin Hileman, that blocker has now been lifted.

He's created some Coda plugins which allow users to manage Git repositories directly within the application, ideal for minimising workflow yet keeping your code version controlled with minimum fuss. Legend.
