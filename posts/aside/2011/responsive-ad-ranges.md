Nathan Ford suggests a possible solution to the [responsive advert](http://sijobling.com/aside/responsive-advertising/) problem Mark Boulton highlighted earlier in the week; introduce a screen resolution _range_ variable to the typical mental model, which now becomes:

range > template > slot > ad

In theory, this approach would allow advertisers and publishers to work seamlessly yet also allow web designers to introduce RWD to large scale projects.
