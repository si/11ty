Mark Boulton identifies a fundamental flaw in adopting responsive web design within an editorial context, specifically when it comes to advertisement placement.

  

As the core revenue channel for most news-based sites, it's not something that can be taken lightly but, unfortunately, there hasn't been much movement with adverts supporting RWD. 

  

Something for the [Internet Advertising Bureau](http://www.iabuk.net/) to consider in 2012, maybe?
