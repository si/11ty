I love this new product from Lego, allowing people to build toys and engage with other players using the [iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/life-of-george/id463288121?ls=1&mt=8). It's hands on creativity mixed with the virtual world and gamification rewards. So many new concepts and all with that Lego charm.
