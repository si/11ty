Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple and Pixar pioneer, sadly passed away yesterday after a number of medical problems.

He was a visionary, a man with the passion and motivation to change the way people used technology, a man who took chances where others wouldn't.

His legacy at Apple will live on forever. A true pioneer. Rest in peace, Mr Jobs.
