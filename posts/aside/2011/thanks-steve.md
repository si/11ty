Using [Jonathan Mak Long's original design](http://jmak.tumblr.com/post/9377189056)Â and Apple's iconic Myriad Pro typeface, I've created a simple wallpaper desktop to honour the passing of Steve Jobs.

Every month, I change my desktop wallpaper so it seems fitting to celebrate the man who inspired many creatives for October.
