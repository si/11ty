Earlier this year, the guys behind [Five Simple Steps](http:/www.fivesimplesteps.com/)Â publications put on a selection of workshops in London to compliment the books, giving the authors a platform to showcase their research and thoughts in more detail whilst improving engagement with their audience.

Thankfully, for those of us who couldn't attend, videos from the workshops are now available online to stream or download. Available from just Â£12 per series, the content is ideal for remote training, honing your skills at your own convenience.
