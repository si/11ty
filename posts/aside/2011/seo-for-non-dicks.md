> The key thing to understand is that the rules of SEO aren't magic or arbitrary. They're based on the goals of a search engine, which is to _find relevant results_. Relevance implies _genuineness_, and genuineness implies _trust_. So, shockingly, you should try to make your site's content _trustworthy, genuine and relevant_.
