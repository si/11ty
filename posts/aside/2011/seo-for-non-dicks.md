> The key thing to understand is that the rules of SEO arenâ€™t magic or arbitrary. Theyâ€™re based on the goals of a search engine, which is to _find relevant results_. Relevance implies _genuineness_, and genuineness implies _trust_. So, shockingly, you should try to make your siteâ€™s content _trustworthy, genuine and relevant_.
