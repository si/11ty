This is a concept I've been championing across ASOS to the design and front-end engineer communities, how we can start introducing [motion in the browser](http://slides.com/si/motion/).

The slide deck is heavily focused towards our internal audience but many points can be reiterated to any audience (and there shouldn't be anything potentially sensitive to the business).

It touches on why motion is an important aspect of design, the different patterns possible, some of the potential  caveats and examples to get the juices flowing.
