<p>It’s refreshing to see more schools connecting young students with alternative career paths compared to the classic higher education route. Our son’s school is working with the <a href="https://apprenticeship.academy/">Apprenticeship Academy</a> to provide education and options from a younger age (Y9) to surface important information earlier on in their education.</p>
<p>In my opinion, apprenticeships can be a more practical and affordable option for many. This morning, I was listening to one of my podcasting heroes <a href="https://shows.acast.com/18dcd5db-f898-42c6-ab31-3a1853c1a645/67274081c715c55b4a13ddc7">Adam Buxton talk to the brilliant Kerri Godliman</a> about how their parents of the "Boomer generation" benefitted from apprenticeships with traditional craft-based skills, something that would be hard for AI to replace in today's society but equally appreciated and satisfying for the professionals.</p>
