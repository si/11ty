<p>As I was leaving ASOS, I wanted to make sure the Tech Podcast which I originally instigated was setup to continue.</p>
<p>In my final moments, we organised a conversation with the Director of DEI, Sunaina and fellow EM, Lucy, on the strategy towards neurodiversity which I was convinced to participate in last minute.</p>
<p>This was the final result which I'm really pleased to be associated with.</p>
