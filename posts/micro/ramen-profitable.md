TIL about the phrase "ramen profitable". &#x1f35c;

According to Collins dictionaty, it is "barely profitable, just enough to allow the founder to live on the cheapest diet […] only enough money to be able to afford the basic foodstuff ramen noodles is being made."

It's a sad state of affairs if this is a familiar existence as an entrepreneur - hardly inspiring for people to innovate and go solo.
