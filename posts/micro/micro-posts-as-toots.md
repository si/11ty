<p>If all goes to plan, this micro post should automatically post a toot to my Mastodon account (via an IFTTT web hook), all thanks to Matthias Ott's helpful tutorial https://matthiasott.com/notes/syndicating-posts-personal-website-twitter-mastodon</p>
<p>This is another step to decentralising and owning my content from any walled gardens (nothing against Mastodon but edging my bets).</p>
