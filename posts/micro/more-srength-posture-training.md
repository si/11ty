According to a recent study of resistance exercise for the elderly in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism (IJSNEM) https://apple.news/ALtI1eTWWQ22nNhHAok-PnQ, it was found that older people respond well to strength training. Even those in their eighties and nineties who had never lifted weights showed great improvement after starting a programme.

This is why I'm keen to improve my health in 2024. Whilst I'm in my forties, I can prepare my body for a healthier future after some reality checks with family in December.

I currently walk over 3km daily with #NewDogSpam but I want to focus on strength and posture as well. The new job in Milton Keynes has access to a free gym so I can compliment the cardio with strength training there.

World Health Organisation guidelines state that all adults should be doing muscle-strengthening exercises two or three days a week, as well as 150 minutes of aerobic exercise. Let's use it.
