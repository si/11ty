<p>I like <a href="https://leaddev.com/community-corner/how-give-feedback-without-killing-morale">this article from Mathias Meyer about creating a feedback culture</a> in your team. He covers a broad range of ideas and concepts but this bit struck home with me…</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>What feedback would be most valuable to your team? Think about this from your perspective and theirs. Ask your team if they have specific areas they’d like feedback on? What would that feedback need to look like to be helpful to them?<br>What are reasonable timeframes and places to provide feedback? Should feedback be given on a personal level, in a performance review, in the moment, in meetings with others present, or in private?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've recently been facilitating some "focus feedback hour" workshops where teams come together to focus on their peers with 2 simple questions for each person:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>What has Bob done well that you recently observed?</li>
<li>What do you think Bob should try doing or learning next quarter?</li>
</ol>
<p>These two questions encourage positive and constructive feedback from recent examples and what their focus could be for the next 3 months.</p>
<p>When the results come through, individuals can identify themes and outliers to discuss with their line manager as part of regular reflections and reviews, and structure some goals or objectives for the next season.</p>
