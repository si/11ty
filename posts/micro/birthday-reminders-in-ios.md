<p>I like to use my phone contacts birthday fields as annual reminders to arrange any deliveries but often find out too late, typically on the day due to notification fatigue.</p>
<p>You can set notifications to a week before, just search for <code>Birthday</code> in iOS Settings and change it to a week before.</p>

<p>(It would be nice if you could select more than one option here - especially for birthdays as you're likely to send a message as well as a gift before).</p>
