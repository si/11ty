<p>I've just been <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/app/books/ikigai-en">listening to an audiobook</a> about the Japanese concept of Ikigai which is derived from tried and tested practices where people live a long and prosperous life.</p>
<p>What I like about Ikigai is it focuses on purpose with an eye on health and well-being, stress levels and health, diet and exercise.</p>
<p>This links to a lot of my current thinking around my purpose; I've been reading a lot about purpose &amp; intentionality lately but it also overlaps very well with the PETALS S for Serenity￼.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/ikigai-en">listening to the audiobook</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/3BZkdCa">grabbing a copy</a> if you want to learn more like I will.</p>
