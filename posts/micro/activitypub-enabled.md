<p>Today, I learned of the ActivityPub Wordpress plugin via the Daily Tech News Show podcast (now available on hosted sites). </p>
<p>It prompted me to test it out with my own self-hosted blog which was seamless. </p>
<p>Now content from this blog is available to follow on the fediverse, through your favoured Mastodon client and other open platforms. </p>
<p>I’m posting this from the Wordpress iOS app to see how simple I can make quick thoughts. Let’s see. </p>
