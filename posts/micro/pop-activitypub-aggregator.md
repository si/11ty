WHY?
A single source of existing social media habit tracking, distributed with an ActivityPub feed to follow on the fediverse. 
It automates the sharing part often encouraged on existing social media accounts, simplifying the user flow and effort required to publicise activity tracking. 
ActivityPub is gaining popularity amongst the fediverse community with the demise of Twitter and shift to a decentralised approach.

HOW?
Verbs to social media accounts, e.g. Untapped = "drinking", Strava = "running" or "cycling", Letterboxd = "watching"
Connect with Oauth to link social media accounts with main account.
Homepage shows connected accounts with most recent activities and link to the feed URL. 
Open source solution to fork and configure self-hosted on personal domain, e.g. activities.sijobling.com
Shared hosting on central website like sijobling.activitypub.me (paid tier to sustain hosting costs)
