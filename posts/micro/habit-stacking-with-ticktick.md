<p>If you've read <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits by James Clear</a>, you should be familiar with the concept of habit stacking. (If you haven't, I'd recommend it - even if it's just the <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/atomic-habits-en">Blinkist blink</a> to get familiar with the concepts).</p>
<p>I have personally found this a great way to maintain habitual routines and also feel the added benefit of completing multiple things together (who said multi-tasking isn't possible?)</p>
<p>I tend to find this really useful in my morning routine. I have multiple daily "habits" in my <a href="https://sijobling.com/ticktick">TickTick</a> such as exercise, listening to podcasts, reading or learning and eating healthy so I can stack some of these together by listening to an educational podcast whilst running or walking with a 500ml bottle of water - 4 in 1!</p>
<p>As an added bonus in <a href="https://sijobling.com/ticktick">TickTick</a>, you can group habits by time of the day (morning, afternoon, evening and other) - this is another great way to visualise your habit stack potential all together.</p>
