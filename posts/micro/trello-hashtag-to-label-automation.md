Ever since Trello retired the #hashtag label keyboard shortcut from the web UI, I've found it quite difficult to categorise my cards.

I've now created a little hack with the automation to aid this. It's a manual setup but simpler in the long run.

Create a rule with a trigger where the name contains a <code>#hashtag</code> then set the label to a suitable value.

For example, if I create a card that contains <code>#me</code>, it gets assigned a Personal label. If it's <code>#team</code>, the Team Name label is assigned.
