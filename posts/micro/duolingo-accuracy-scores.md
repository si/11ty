<p>As an avid Duolingo user and addicted data junkie, I really love tracking my progress over time to the point I even keep a personal Google Sheet based on the weekly email reports I get at the weekend.</p>
<p>Whilst it's great to see how much time I'm spending on number of lessons, what I do find frustrating is the lack of accuracy to show personal progress.</p>
<p>It was enlightening to see the number of mistakes in the 2024 Review but I'd love to see these on a more regular basis.</p>
