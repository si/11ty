<p>I've been playing around with iOS Shortcuts recently to simplify some common routines for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my favourites is my gym routine:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gym-automation-ios-shortcut-987x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-14051"/></figure>
<p>When I arrive at the gym location at certain times, my iPhone instantly goes into Do Not Disturb and Airplane mode to remove all notifications and save battery (as the signal is pretty bad).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It then sets media volume to 70% (it's normally at 100% for the car stero system), plays the latest Defected Radio Podcast in Overcast (house music mix for that uninterrupted energy)&nbsp; and opens the gym's iOS app ready to connect to their machines with NFC .&nbsp;</p>
