I'm in a few different WhatsApp groups where we tend to have many events organised and planned but easily get lost in the noise of chat.

What I've recently started doing (as group organisers) is pinning an &#x1f5d3;&#xfe0f;<code> **UPCOMING SCHEDULE**</code> message which the owner can edit and participants can quickly find.

Much easier than endlessly scrolling through messages or searching.
