Here's an idea for your scrum (sprint) ceremonies:

Pick a theme at the start of the year then use each letter from the alphabet to name something appropriate for that sprint.

For example, let's say 2025 is sweet food themed, the first sprint could be called "Anzac biscuit". You can even add some visuals with emojis like &#x1f36a;

Free bonus: If it is food related, how about volunteers bring that item to any team days or end of sprint retrospectives for a bit of fun?
