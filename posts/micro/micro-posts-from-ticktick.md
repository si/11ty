With a diluted market of microblogging platforms, I'd like to shift to a POSSE model but lack something convenient to post on Wordpress. Until now. 
I'm a big fan of automation, especially if I can use tools like IFTTT to hook me up with my blog. 
This is a completed Ticktick in my Micro list that's hooked up through an IFTTT recipe. 
It should even use hashtags.
