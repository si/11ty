<p>It's official! I'll be talking at the next MK Geek Night in June at Bletchley's South Central Institute of Technology about <a href="https://petals.team/">#PETALS</a> and how it can help your team be healthier.</p>
<p><a href="https://mkgeeknight.co.uk/events/mkgn-48#Si">MKGN #48 on June 6, 2024</a></p>
<p>I can't wait to get back into speaking after the Winter break, especially now I've experimented with the framework in a new company with a different culture and tooling.</p>
<p>Buy your tickets now whilst early bird prices are available - it's going to be a wonderful evening of talks and they'll go quickly.</p>
<p>Thanks to Richard Wiggins and David Hughes for giving me this opportunity, especially alongside such esteemed speakers and talks from the past 47 events - love what you're doing with the Milton Keynes tech community.</p>
