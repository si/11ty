<p>I use Trello for <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> of my daily action planning, especially at work.<br>I like all the automation available to quickly create and track what I have to do on a daily, weekly or ongoing basis.</p>
<p>One feature I really like to use are the labels so I can categorise the type of work I'm doing but, since they dropped the <code>#hashtag</code> keyboard shortcut, I've had to heavily rely on the native (Butler) automation.</p>
<p>I've been wanting to automatically assign labels based on a bunch of keywords for a long time but only recently discovered you can use a regexp rule to do this.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Automation</strong> settings, use the <em>Card Content</em> trigger with <em>the name of a card contains</em> and set the text to <code>regex:/(word1|word2|word3|word4|word5)</code>, then select the <em>Action</em> to add your desired label to the card.</p>
