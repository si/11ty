_Do you have a side project you want to work on but struggle to focus on or complete? Have you thought about sharing your challenges?_

That’s where **On The Side** comes in.

I’ve long been an advocate of side projects since working in tech. In fact, some of my best ideas have come from side projects; from hacking together a [World Cup calendar](https://worldcupkickoff.com/), to meeting [fellow geeks for a monthly beer](https://multipack.co.uk/); from sharing my [love for house music](https://housefinesse.com/) to [ranting about working in tech](https://verbaldiary.show/).

All these projects had one thing in common though - _sharing_.

The old cliché “a problem shared is a problem halved” is often true. This theory is proven when working in tech as well. As a team lead in software development, I often encourage engineers to pair (or even mob) program when trying to solve a problem. Granted, it’s not always plain-sailing but there is plenty evidence to demonstrate this approach works.

When working on side projects, I mostly do this as a lone ranger. It’s normally down to the situation - I’m sat alone on the train or at home with a computer and some time on my hands. I have a loose plan of how to approach a problem, working in isolation. Then I encounter an issue which takes me down some rabbit holes. Then life happens.

My day job takes up most my time or I have normal family demands. My weekends are filled with activities to enjoy time with people around me. Then Monday morning comes around again and I’ve made little-to-no progress on that thing I want to work on.

As I shared my stories with [Ben Russell](https://twitter.com/Brussells), another self-confessed techie who is struggling to finish some side projects, we realised we have a similar problem. We knew we wouldn’t be alone in this world either:

- There must be plenty other people out there who struggle to focus on finishing their own passions.
- There must be other people out there who’d like to work together on a project.
- There must be a better way to organise this problem.

My day job is to focus on delivering good quality software, frequently and with a prioritised iterative approach based on user demand. Is there a way I can bring this approach to side projects?

This is where _On The Side_ comes in.

**On The Side is a collaboration space for people who want help delivering their side projects.** It’s a place where you can encourage each other to focus on finishing a task, where you can ask questions or get support on those problems you’re stuck on.

You might even want to join forces with others in the community to build a new thing. [I've been in situations before](https://twitter.com/Si/status/1140257709826199552) where I just want to share a project idea for validation, better suggestions or just technical support. This would be a great place to do that.

At the moment, it’s barebones to see if the idea has legs. We’ve setup a [Slack workspace (open invite)](https://join.slack.com/t/onthesideworkspace/shared_invite/enQtNjc0MTY4MTA4ODIxLWQ1ZWJhMzQ2OTg2MzJiNDAwZGNhNDM3NTFiOGIyM2E5MDQ1NGM2N2E4YWFkNjE3N2NmNzdmZTNmYzU2YjJjZDY) to get people involved. We’ll be experimenting with appropriate tools to see what works to help organise our projects (such as [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=8cf3ec5daa3a4582a28b542a4fb23c37) for shared notes and progress).

It won’t be prescriptive - you can use whatever tools work for you. However, I am keen to find a simple mechanism that could facilitate regular "asynchronous standups” across individual’s diaries.

We have set some initial guidelines and conventions to get started:

- **#general** - chit-chat about anything
- **#introductions** - a place for people to introduce themselves and meet others
- **#p-on-the-side** - all things related to this project (On The Side).
- **#p-any-project** - any project to be discussed, hyphenated and prefixed with `p-`. (We encourage public channels but, if you prefer, you can invite people to private channels.)
- **#help** - help with any general problems you might be having, typically channelled correctly.
- **#h-topic** - help with any topical problems, all prefixed with `h-`.
- **#demo** - a place to show-off your latest thing; from a prototype to a fully-fledged app

For now, [join the _On The Side_ Slack space](https://join.slack.com/t/onthesideworkspace/shared_invite/enQtNjc0MTY4MTA4ODIxLWQ1ZWJhMzQ2OTg2MzJiNDAwZGNhNDM3NTFiOGIyM2E5MDQ1NGM2N2E4YWFkNjE3N2NmNzdmZTNmYzU2YjJjZDY) to find out what's going on and how we can help each other to finish our side projects. I'm keen to see if there's much appetite for a community like this so please spread the word with people you think might be in a similar position to us.

Let's see where this goes.
