Before I left ASOS in 2023, I recorded a discussion with Callum and Elizabeth about the experimentation approach in tech for the ASOS Tech Podcast.

It was an opportunity for me to reflect on my personal time working in the old experimentation team back in 2015-2017, revisiting how things have evolved since then and explore some recent examples on how ASOS and their customers have benefited from it. I selfishly wanted to host this episode as well after producing the podcast for the best part of 2 years, mostly due to the topic being something quite close to me.

Due to scheduling, this was actually released _after_ I left ASOS but it's wonderful to hear how the episode turned out (once Adrian had worked his production magic) and leave something behind for my old colleagues.
