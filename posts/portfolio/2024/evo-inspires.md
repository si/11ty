I was recently asked by David Dowdall to talk to him for their Evo Inspires video series, a platform for leaders in tech to share some personal stories that could inspires others.

It was an honour to be featured alongside such successful and reputable names from across the industry so I tried to share thoughts on failing fast, encouraging line managers and how to support teams in a hybrid/remote world.

[Watch the video on David's Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daviddowdalljava_i-had-the-pleasure-of-speaking-with-si-jobling-activity-7173269769960280064--knZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and let us know your thoughts.
