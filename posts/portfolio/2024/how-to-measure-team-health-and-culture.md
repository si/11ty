Back in July, I was invited up to Auto Trader's headquarters in Manchester to talk to Pete on their Roadmap Product & Tech podcast about team health and how PETALS has grown over the past few years.

I was honoured to be asked on their podcast as I've been very impressed with what they've done over the past year (we even compared notes last year based on what we did on the ASOS Tech Podcast). It was a great opportunity to meet Pete and the team in person but also share my story to a wider community, even diving into some of the roots and challenges faced with the idea of a framework for _measuring_ team health.
