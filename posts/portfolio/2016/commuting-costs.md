A long-term pet project to monitor and understand spending habits around commuting. A mini web app which records fuel, train and car park costs in a responsive mobile-first UX.

I came up with the original idea way back in 2009, quickly knocking together a CakePHP app to get an idea of how the framework works and a simple mechanism to start recording the data. Over the years, I used it as an opportunity to push new technical enhancements and techniques but also considering how they might be applied to a real world scenario. It was a real mix of tech innovation combined with user-centred requirements.

Check out the [working prototype on Heroku](https://shielded-shelf-8688.herokuapp.com).
