[![](/img/posts/portfolio/hart_and_harvey_photography_website.jpg "Hart & Harvey Photography website")](http://2017.sijobling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/hart_and_harvey_photography_website.jpg)

When [Darren Harvey Photography](http://www.hartandharveyphotography.co.uk/darren-harvey-photography/) and [Matthew Hart Photography](http://www.hartandharveyphotography.co.uk/matthew-hart-photography/) joined forces in May 2009, they approached me to help organise their online campaign, starting with a promotional website.

Having drafted out the initial prototype, I proposed a simple yet elegant design to compliment their new branding, fitting in with the typical design associated with photography websites.

The goal was to promote the diverse range of photography services available, predominantly [wedding photography](http://www.hartandharveyphotography.co.uk/wedding-photography/) but also [family portraits](http://www.hartandharveyphotography.co.uk/portraits/) and [commercial photography](http://www.hartandharveyphotography.co.uk/commercial/). We achieved this by opting for a simple navigation structure while leaving images to portray the quality of photography available - after all, a picture says more than a thousand words.

I wanted to keep the grid system relatively simple for the website, adopting the Rule of Third which is a familiar technique within photography. The photography used on the website fill two-thirds of the canvas, leaving one-third of the canvas for necessary content, knowing full well that users only wanted minimal content and the images to do the talking.

The website will constantly be evolving over the years but, to set a basic foundation, I am particularly proud of this design and I know Matthew and Darren are highly satisfied with the end result.

Additional services supplied to Hart & Harvey Photography include SEO, online advertising, integrating social media into their business and ongoing technical support.
